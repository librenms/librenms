         remain operationally disabled due to other conditions (such as

         configured to send untagged frames and no Voice-VLAN will be

         A value of taggedFrames(3) means that the IP Phones are
         configured to send tagged frames; the Voice-VLAN will be
         created and QoS will be applied accordingly.
