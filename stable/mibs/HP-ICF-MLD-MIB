        DESCRIPTION "Type definition.  This type distinguishes the 
                    different ways of tracking this device has for 
                    multicast joins.  The method of tracking is primarily 
                    determined by the igmp/mld feature configuration.  In 
                    particular if the snooping feature is enabled then
                    port level tracking is the default which results in 
                    filtered groups.  If the snooping feature is 
                    disabled then joins will result in standard groups
                    being tracked by this device.  When hardware resources
                    are exhauseted for multicast filtered bridging, joins
                    may result in standard groups even though the snooping
                    feature is enabled.  Mini groups may be used when 
                    other resources, such as RAM, are low or exhausted."
