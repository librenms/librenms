    DESCRIPTION
        "The MIB module to describe active system processes.
        Virtual Machine refers to those OS which can run the 
        code or process of a different executional model OS.
        Virtual Process assume the executional model 
        of a OS which is different from Native OS. Virtual
        Processes are also referred as Tasks.
        Thread is a sequence of instructions to be executed
        within a program. Thread which adhere to POSIX standard
        is referred as a POSIX thread."
