Requirements:
-------------
Miminum:
* PHP 4.4.1 or higher 
  (earlier versions might work but is unsupported)
* GD 2.0.30 or higher
  (earlier versions might work but is unsupported)

Recommended:
* PHP 4.4.9 
* PHP Builtin GD 2.0.34 library

Installation
------------
0. Make sure that the PHP version is compatible with the stated requirements
   and that the PHP installation has support for the GD library. 
   Please run phpinfo() to check if GD library
   is supported in the installation. 
   If the GD library doesn't seem to be installed 
   please consult the PHP manual under section "Image" for
   instructions on where to find this library. Please refer to
   the manual section "Verifying your PHP installation"
   
1. Unzip and copy the files to a directory of your choice where Your
   httpd sever can access them. 
   For a global site installation you should copy the files to 
   somewhere in the PHP search path. 

2. Check that the default directory paths in jpg-config.inc
   for cache directory and TTF directory suits your installation. 
   Note1: The default directories are different depending on if
   the library is running on Windows or UNIX.
   Note2: Apache/PHP must have write permission to your cache 
   directory if you enable the cache feature. By default the cache
   is disabled.

3. Check that all rest of the DEFINE in jpg-config.inc 
   is setup to your preference. The default should be fine
   for most users. (See also Note 3. below)
   
4. If any problems are encounted please start by reading the FAQ on 
   http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/jpgraphfaq.php.


Documentation
-------------
The installation includes HTML documentation and reference guide for the
library. The portal page for all the documentation is
<YOUR-INSTALLATION-DIRECTORY>/docs/index.html


Troubleshooting
---------------
0. Make sure your PHP installation has the minimum requirements and has
   the GD library enabled (most modern installations fulfills the minimmum
   requirements). See chapter 3.1 in the manual.

1. If an empty page is returned back when running an example check
   the following

     i)  Increase the maximum memory allowed by PHP (in php.ini) to at least 32MB
    ii)  Enable all error messages and notices in php.ini (error_reporting = E_ALL)
    III) Make sure output buffering is disabled in php.ini (output_buffering = Off) 
         this will make it possible to see the errors more easily
    IV)  Disable any PHP accelerometer you may have installed (e.g. Zend Cache)

   Then try running the example again. Most likely an error message will
   now be shown that will give further information on what is wrong.
   For further clarifiction on the casues for the error messages see
   the FAQ section on the WEB site.

2. If you are running IIS and Win2k and get the error "Can't find
   font' when trying to use TTF fonts then try to change you paths
   to UNIX style, i.e. "/usr/local/fonts/ttf/". Remember that the
   path is absolute and not relative to the htdocs catalogue. Some 
   versions of GD for Windows also need you to set the environment
   variable GDFONTPATH for GD to find the fonts.

3. If you are using the cache please make sure that you have
   set the permissions correctly for the cache directory so that
   Apache/PHP can write to that directory.
