<H1><A NAME="6">6 Using image maps with JpGraph</A></H1>
<P> Image maps, or client side image (CSIM) as they are known is fully
 supported in JpGraph. It gives you the opportunity to create hot-spots
 in the graphs which allows you to build a set of &quot;drill-down&quot; graphs.</P>
<P> In the following section is based on the assumption that the reader
 is familiar with the basic concepts of client side image map in HTML.</P>
<P> To shortly recapitulate. Client side image maps consists of two
 parts. The first part is the actual image and the second part is a
 mapping that gives the coordinates for areas in the image which should
 be marked as hot spots (i.e. click-able by the user). The library can
 automatically generate these coordinate maps from a given graph.</P>
<P> Through out the manual areas of the graph that may be used as a
 hotspot is given in conjuction with the general description of that
 area.</P>
