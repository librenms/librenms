<H2><A NAME="10_6">10.6 Positioning objects in the Gantt plot</A></H2>
<P> Bars and Milestones need both a vertical position and a horizontal
 position. The horizontal start position is specified as a date, e.g.
 &quot;2001-06-23&quot;, and the vertical positions are specified as a number
 [0,1,2,3,...]. This vertical number indicates the position from the top
 where the object should be placed. To understand this you might imagine
 a number of &quot;invisible&quot; horizontal bands with a certain height. If you
 specify 0 as the vertical position the bar will be placed in the first
 band, specify 3 and the bar will be placed in the fourth band and so
 on.</P>
<P> It is perfectly legal, and perhaps even desirable to leave &quot;gaps&quot;
 when laying out bands to group related activities. So, for example you
 could have three activities/bars at positions 1,2,3 and then another 2
 bars at position 6,7 leaving band 0,4,5 empty.</P>
<P> All these &quot;invisible bands&quot; have the same height (equ-spaced). The
 height of each band is automatically determined and depends on both the
 method of layout ( as specified by (GanttChart::SetLayout()) and the
 individual heights of the individual bars and titles. The rules are
 quite simple:</P>
<UL>
<LI> If you use layout=GANTT_FROMTOP (the default and most common) the
 height will equal the height (+ a margin) of the highest gantt bar. The
 height calculation of each bar takes into account both the actual bar,
 the title, and any left- right-marks (more about that later) that may
 be present. The name &quot;fromtop&quot; refers to that when you have explicitly
 specified a height the bars will usually be added from band 0 and
 onwards and hence being added from the top. (This might leave empty
 space at the bottom of the plot area in the graph if the height of the
 graph has been explicitly specified).</LI>
<LI> If you use layout=GANTT_EVEN the bars are evenly (hence the name)
 spread out over the available height in the gantt chart and no
 consideration is taken of the individual bars heights. Note that if you
 use automatic sizing you cant use even layout. It just doesn't make
 sense. Even layout is for those cases when you deliberately specify a
 very large image and want the bars evenly distributed using the full
 height.</LI>
</UL>
