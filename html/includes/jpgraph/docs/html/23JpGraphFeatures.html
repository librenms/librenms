<H2><A NAME="2_3">2.3 JpGraph Features</A></H2>
<P> JpGraph library is an OO graph library which makes it easy to both
 draw a &quot;quick and dirty&quot; graph with a minimum of code and quite complex
 graphs which requires a very fine grain of control. The library tries
 to assign sensible default values for most parameters hence making the
 learning curve quite flat since for most of the time very few commands
 is required to draw graphs with a pleasing esthetic look.</P>
<P> Some highlights of available features are</P>
<UL>
<LI> Flexible scales, supports text-lin, text-log, lin-lin, lin-log,
 log-lin and log-log and integer scales.</LI>
<LI> Supports both PNG, GIF and JPG graphic formats. Note that the
 available formats are dependent on the specific PHP installation where
 the library is used.</LI>
<LI>Supports caching of generated graphs to lessen burden of a HTTP
 server.</LI>
<LI> Supports batch mode to only generate images to a file</LI>
<LI>Supports client side image maps which makes it easy to produce drill
 down images.</LI>
<LI>Intelligent auto-scaling which gravitates towards esthetic values,
 i.e. multiples of 2:s and 5:s</LI>
<LI>Fully supports manual scaling, with fine grain control of position
 of ticks.</LI>
<LI>Supports background images with different formatting options</LI>
<LI>Supports color and brightness adjustments of images directly in PHP.</LI>
<LI>User specified grace for auto-scaling</LI>
<LI> Supports up to two different y-scale, it is possible to have
 different left and right y-scale and add plots to both</LI>
<LI>Supports, line-plots, filled line-plots, accumulated line-plots, bar
 plots, accumulated bar plots, grouped bar plots, error plots, line
 error plots, scatter plots, gantt-charts, radar plots, 2D and 3D pie
 charts.</LI>
<LI>Supports unlimited number of plots in each graph, makes it easy to
 compose complex graph which consists of several plot types</LI>
<LI>User specified position of axis</LI>
<LI>Supports color gradient fill in seven styles</LI>
<LI>Designed as a flexible OO framework which makes it easy to add new
 types of plots</LI>
<LI>Supports automatic legend generation</LI>
<LI>Supports both vertical and horizontal grids</LI>
<LI>Supports anti-aliasing of lines</LI>
<LI>Supports background images as well as unlimited number of icons in
 the graph</LI>
<LI>Supports rotation of linear graphs</LI>
<LI>More then 400 named colors</LI>
<LI>Designed modularly - you don't have to include code which isn't used</LI>
<LI> ...and many many more features</LI>
</UL>
<P> In addition to these high level features the library has been
 designed to be orthogonal and consistent in its' naming convention. For
 example, to specify color each object (i.e. axis, grids, texts, titles
 etc) within the graph implements the method SetColor() with the same
 signature.</P>
