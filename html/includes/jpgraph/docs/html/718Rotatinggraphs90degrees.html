<H2><A NAME="7_18">7.18 Rotating graphs 90 degrees</A></H2>
<P> In section <A href="7adv.html#10_2">10.2</A> you can read about
 arbitrary rotation of the graphs. For most practical purposes rotation
 of 90 degrees is most useful. This could for example be used to plot
 horizontal bar graphs.</P>
<P> The slight complication with general rotation is that the margins
 also rotates, this means that if you rotate a graph 90 degrees the left
 margin in the image was originally the bottom margin. In additional by
 default the center of the rotation is the center of the plot area and
 not the entire image (if all the margins are symmetrical then they will
 of course coincide). This means that depending on your margin the
 center of the rotation will move. You can read more about this and how
 to manually set the center for rotation in the section about rotation, <A
href="7adv.html#10_2">10.2</A></P>
<P> This is just a slight inconvenience which you have to take into
 account when you need to set an explicit margin with a call to <A href="../ref/Graph.html#_GRAPH_SETMARGIN">
Graph::SetMargin()</A></P>
<P> However, in order to make a rotation of 90 degrees much easier you
 can easily rotate a graph 90 degrees and set the correct margin with a
 call to <A href="../ref/Graph.html#_GRAPH_SET90ANDMARGIN">
Graph::Set90AndMargin()</A> The parameter to this method lets you
 specify the margins as you will see them in the image without having to
 think of what becomes what after the rotation.</P>
<P> So, the only thing you need to do is call this method and then the
 graph will have been rotated 90 degrees.</P>
