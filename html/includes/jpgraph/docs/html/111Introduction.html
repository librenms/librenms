<P> Canvas graph is really not a graph. It a blank sheet of paper which
 you can use to draw arbitrary shapes and still have access to some of
 the convenient features of JpGraph.</P>
<P> You can work with a canvas in different levels of complexity. You
 can for example work directly with the Image class which provides a
 large number of primitives for drawing but requires that you use
 absolute pixel coordinates.</P>
<P> You can also make life a little bit easier by using a canvas scale.
 This lets you define your own scale on the canvas which often makes it
 easier by letting you work on a grid you have specified yourself. It
 also makes it very easy to re-scale you image automatically by just
 changing your scale. For example to half the size of you drawing you
 just make the scale twice as large.</P>
<P> To give you some help in working with different canvas you should
 include the &quot;jpgraph_canvtools.php&quot; file when working on canvases. This
 is not strictly necessary but it will give you some nice abstraction to
 help you create your masterpieces.</P>
<P> As another (concrete) example on the use of a canvas the figure
 below is a listing of font styles available with JpGraph.<DIV class="example">
