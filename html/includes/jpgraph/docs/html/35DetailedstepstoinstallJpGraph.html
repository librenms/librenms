<LI>If You are insatlling the 1.x branch then make sure the PHP version
 used is at least 4.3.x (preferable 4.3.10 or higher) and that the PHP
 version have compiled support for GD library. It is absolutely critical
 that GD is fully working. Please see the earlier sections on how to
 make sure. JpGraph supports both GD 1.x and GD 2.x However it is
 strongly recommended to use GD 2.x since that will improve performance
 and support true color images as well as alphablending.
<P> If You are insatlling the 2.x branch then make sure the PHP version
 used is at least 5.0.1 (preferable 5.0.5 or higher) and that the PHP
 version have compiled support for GD 2.x library. Please note that the
 2.x branch will<B> not</B> work with PHP 4.x</P>
</LI>
<LI>Unzip and copy the files to a directory of your choice.</LI>
<LI>Set up the directory paths in<I> jpg-config.inc.php</I> where the
 cache directory should be and where your TTF directory is. Note that
 Apache/PHP must have write permission in your cache directory.</LI>
<LI> Check that all rest of the DEFINE in the top of JpGraph.php is
 setup to your preference. The default should be fine for most users.
 (See also Note 5. below) Specifically check that the settings of
 USE_GD2_LIBRARY reflects your installation, (should be true if you have
 GD2 installed, false otherwise).</LI>
<LI>Make sure PHP have write privileges to your cache directory if you
 plan on using the cache feature.</LI>
<LI> Some windows installations seems to have a problem with a PHP
 script ending in a newline (This newline seems to be sent to the
 browser and will cause a Header already sent error). If you have this
 problem try remove all trailing newlines in the jpgraph* files</LI>
<LI> Read (really!) <A href="http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/jpgraphfaq.html">
the JpGraph FAQ</A>.</LI>
