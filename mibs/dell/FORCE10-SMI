		DESCRIPTION
			"f10Experiment provides a root object identifier
			from which experimental mibs may be temporarily
			based.  mibs are typicially based here if they
			fall in one of two categories
			1) are IETF work-in-process mibs which have not
			been assigned a permanent object identifier by
			the IANA.
			2) are force10 work-in-process which has not been
			assigned a permanent object identifier by the
			force10 assigned number authority, typicially because
			the mib is not ready for deployment.

			NOTE WELL:  support for mibs in the f10Experiment
			subtree will be deleted when a permanent object
			identifier assignment is made."
