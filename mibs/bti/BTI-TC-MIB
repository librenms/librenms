-- OSS Integration 
-- BTI Systems Inc. can provide customers with direct access to 
-- network element SNMP MIBs for use for integration to OSS systems. 
-- Customers must note the following caveats:
--
-- 1) Performance: The BTI Systems Inc. MIBS are performance tested for
-- use with the BTI Systems proNX 900 Node Controller and proNX 9000 
-- Network Manager. Customers are responsible for conducting their 
-- own testing to ensure that the BTI Systems Inc. NE interfaces meet 
-- the needs of their proposed usage. BTI Systems Inc. makes no
-- guarantees that any proposed usage will meet customer requirements.
--
-- 2) Changes between releases: BTI Systems Inc. SNMP MIBs are subject 
-- to change as support for new functionality is introduced. BTI  
-- Systems Inc. strives to maintain backward compatibility of MIBs 
-- across releases but this is not guaranteed and BTI Systems Inc. 
-- reserves the right to deprecate or remove support for obsolete 
-- MIB elements. OSS integrators must be careful not to rely on 
-- functionality that is marked as deprecated as it may be unsupported 
-- in a subsequent release. Customers that integrate directly to BTI 
-- Systems Inc. MIBs are responsible for all OSS development and 
-- integration testing that may arise from MIB changes between releases 
-- of BTI Systems Inc. software.

InetAddressType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A value that represents a type of Internet address.

         unknown(0)  An unknown address type.  This value MUST
                     be used if the value of the corresponding
                     InetAddress object is a zero-length string.
                     It may also be used to indicate an IP address
                     that is not in one of the formats defined
                     below.

         ipv4(1)     An IPv4 address as defined by the
                     InetAddressIPv4 textual convention.

         ipv6(2)     An IPv6 address as defined by the
                     InetAddressIPv6 textual convention.

         ipv4z(3)    A non-global IPv4 address including a zone
                     index as defined by the InetAddressIPv4z
                     textual convention.

         ipv6z(4)    A non-global IPv6 address including a zone
                     index as defined by the InetAddressIPv6z
                     textual convention.

         dns(16)     A DNS domain name as defined by the
                     InetAddressDNS textual convention.

         Each definition of a concrete InetAddressType value must be
         accompanied by a definition of a textual convention for use
         with that InetAddressType.

         To support future extensions, the InetAddressType textual
         convention SHOULD NOT be sub-typed in object type definitions.
         It MAY be sub-typed in compliance statements in order to
         require only a subset of these address types for a compliant
         implementation.

         Implementations must ensure that InetAddressType objects
         and any dependent objects (e.g., InetAddress objects) are
         consistent.  An inconsistentValue error must be generated
         if an attempt to change an InetAddressType object would,
         for example, lead to an undefined InetAddress value.  In

         particular, InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs must be
         changed together if the address type changes (e.g., from
         ipv6(2) to ipv4(1))."

InetAddress ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

    DESCRIPTION
        "Denotes a generic Internet address.

         An InetAddress value is always interpreted within the context
         of an InetAddressType value.  Every usage of the InetAddress
         textual convention is required to specify the InetAddressType
         object that provides the context.  It is suggested that the
         InetAddressType object be logically registered before the
         object(s) that use the InetAddress textual convention, if
         they appear in the same logical row.

         The value of an InetAddress object must always be
         consistent with the value of the associated InetAddressType
         object.  Attempts to set an InetAddress object to a value
         inconsistent with the associated InetAddressType
         must fail with an inconsistentValue error.

         When this textual convention is used as the syntax of an
         index object, there may be issues with the limit of 128
         sub-identifiers specified in SMIv2, STD 58.  In this case,
         the object definition MUST include a 'SIZE' clause to
         limit the number of potential instance sub-identifiers;
         otherwise the applicable constraints MUST be stated in
         the appropriate conceptual row DESCRIPTION clauses, or
         in the surrounding documentation if there is no single
         DESCRIPTION clause that is appropriate."

ZeroBasedCounter32 ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION "This TC describes an object that counts events with the
        following semantics: objects of this type will be set to
        zero(0) on creation and will thereafter count appropriate
        events, wrapping back to zero(0) when the value 2^32 is
        reached.

        Provided that an application discovers the new object within
        the minimum time to wrap, it can use the initial value as a
        delta since it last polled the table of which this object is
        part.  It is important for a management station to be aware of
        this minimum time and the actual time between polls, and to
        discard data if the actual time is too long or there is no
        defined minimum time.

        Typically, this TC is used in tables where the INDEX space is
        constantly changing and/or the TimeFilter mechanism is in use."
