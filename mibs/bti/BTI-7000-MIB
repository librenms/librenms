-- Customers must note the following caveats:
--
-- 1) Performance: The BTI Systems Inc. MIBS are performance tested for
-- use with the BTI Systems proNX 900 Node Controller and proNX 9000 
-- Network Manager. Customers are responsible for conducting their 
-- own testing to ensure that the BTI Systems Inc. NE interfaces meet 
-- the needs of their proposed usage. BTI Systems Inc. makes no
-- guarantees that any proposed usage will meet customer requirements.
--
-- 2) Changes between releases: BTI Systems Inc. SNMP MIBs are subject 
-- to change as support for new functionality is introduced. BTI  
-- Systems Inc. strives to maintain backward compatibility of MIBs 
-- across releases but this is not guaranteed and BTI Systems Inc. 
-- reserves the right to deprecate or remove support for obsolete 
-- MIB elements. OSS integrators must be careful not to rely on 
-- functionality that is marked as deprecated as it may be unsupported 
-- in a subsequent release. Customers that integrate directly to BTI 
-- Systems Inc. MIBs are responsible for all OSS development and 
-- integration testing that may arise from MIB changes between releases 
-- of BTI Systems Inc. software.

-- Objects related to cross connections between Virtual Concatenation
-- Group (VCG) entities on Muxponder circuit packs
-- 
-- A listing of provisioned virtual concatenation group (VCG) cross
-- connects is contained in the vcgXCTable of the BTI 7000 Series MIB. 
-- VCG entities are created on the muxponder circuit pack to facilitate 
-- the mapping of client facilities into line facility time slots. The 
-- client facilities are transported over line facility time slots when 
-- the required VCG cross-connects are created. When retrieved, this
-- table provides one row for each provisioned VCG cross connect.
-- 
-- To create a cross connect, a new row of the vcgXCTable must be 
-- created. To delete a cross connect, the corresponding row of the
-- table must be destroyed.

DbBackupAndRestoreCmd ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION  "The MSCP maintains all provisionable data in non-volatile 
			storage so that configuration settings are retained during 
			system shutdowns and restarts. The configuration database 
			is version controlled to facilitate the detection of an
			incompatible software load and/or database.

			The BTI 7000 Series supports user-initiated backup and 
			restore operations of the configuration database through the 
			SNMP Set requests performed on the dbBackupAndRestoreCmd 
			object with a value corresponding to the required action.

			In a backup operation, the database is uploaded to a 
			user-specified network location (that is, a local PC or a 
			remote PC) using the file transfer protocol (FTP), or it is 
			stored locally on the MSCP.

			In a restore operation, the database is restored using a 
			version of the file from an FTP server or locally from the 
			MSCP. The integrity of the file is validated to ensure that 
			it matches the current software load on the BTI 7000 Series.

			The DbBackupAndRestoreCmd textual convention is the value of
                  the dbBackupAndRestoreCmd object, which is used to activate a
                  database backup operation, or the various steps of a database
                  restore operation. These operations are initiated when a set
                  request is performed on the dbBackupAndRestoreCmd object with
                  a value corresponding to the desired action, as explained
                  below. A get request on this type returns the value noOp.
                  
                  The valid values for DbBackupAndRestoreCmd that can be used in
                  a set operation are:
                  - 'invokeBackup': used to perform a database backup operation.
                  The operation may be used to perform a local database backup,
                  or to save the database backup to a remote repository.
                  - 'loadRestore': used to initiate a database restore
                  operation. The operation may be the restoration of a local
                  database backup or of a remote database backup
                  - 'invokeRestore': continues a database restore operation
                  after the loadRestore stage has completed. The database being
                  restored is made active on the SCP circuit pack at this stage.
                  - 'applyRestore':  Obsolete  this functionality is now done as
                  part of the invokeRestore.
                  - 'commitRestore': is used to complete a database restore
                  operation and can be used after the applyRestore action
                  completes
                  - 'cancelRestore': is used to cancel and back out of a
                  database restore operation in progress and can be used before
                  the commitRestore action is called.
                  
                  In order for the set request on the dbBackupAndRestoreCmd
                  object to complete successfully, the values of other objects
                  must be set in the same set request for some of the commands.
                  The additional objects required to be set along with the
                  dbBackupAndRestoreCmd object for each DbBackupAndRestoreCmd
                  value are listed below.

                  dbBackupAndRestoreFtpUser and dbBackupAndRestorePswd object
                  values must also be specified in the set request. The
                  dbBackupAndRestoreCheckAlm object may optionally be set when
                  the invokeBackup action is performed. Also when the
                  dbBackupAndRestoreType is set to remote the
                  dbBackupAndRestorePath is optional. If not specified the
                  default name is used.
                  - loadRestore: must also set dbBackupAndRestoreType. If this
                  object is set to remote, then the dbBackupAndRestoreAddress,
                  dbBackupAndRestorePath, dbBackupAndRestoreFtpUser and
                  dbBackupAndRestorePswd object values must also be specified in
                  the set request. The dbBackupAndRestoreCheckSysName object may
                  be set when the loadRestore action is performed, but is not
                  mandatory.
                  - invokeRestore: must also set
                  dbBackupAndRestoreInvokeFilename to confirm the name of the
                  backed file to be used in the restore operation. Optionally,
                  the dbBackupAndRestoreCheckAlm object may be set.
                  - applyRestore, commitRestore, cancelRestore: no additional

SwUpgradeCmd ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION  "All BTI 7000 Series circuit packs are shipped with 
			pre-loaded software. At system commissioning, it is not 
			necessary to start the system by loading software.
			However, during the life cycle of the BTI 7000 Series, 
			it might be necessary to upgrade the system software. 
			Normally, the system software is upgraded to:

			� Support the functionality of new circuit packs
			� Provide new features for existing circuit packs
			� Add specific software improvements

			Performing a system software upgrade on the BTI 7000 Series 
			is non-service affecting. The upgrade process is designed 
			for application environments that require that the optical 
			signals passing through the BTI 7000 Series are not interrupted.

			The BTI 7000 Series supports a user-initiated software upgrade 
			operation through the SNMP Set requests performed on the 
			swUpgradeCmd object with a value corresponding to the required 
			action.
			
			The SwUpgradeCmd textual convention is the value of the
                  swUpgradeCmd object, which is used to activate the various
                  steps of the software upgrade procedure on the system. These
                  steps are initiated when a set request is performed on the
                  swUpgradeCmd object with a value corresponding to the desired
                  action, as explained below. A get request will return the
                  value noOp.
                  
                  The valid values for SwUpgradeCmd that can be used in a set
                  operation are:
                  - 'checkUpgrade': used to perform a pre-upgrade check of the
                  system to ensure that it is ready for the upgrade process, and
                  that the load files on the server are accessible.
                  - 'loadUpgrade': used to initiate a system upgrade by
                  downloading the load files from a remote server to the SCP
                  software load storage area.
                  - 'invokeUpgrade': continues a system upgrade operation after
                  the loadUpgrade stage has completed. First the upgrade load is
                  installed on all circuit packs in the system, then each card
                  is rebooted to run the upgrade load.
                  - 'commitUpgrade': is used to complete a system upgrade
                  operation and can be used after the invkUpgrade action
                  completes
                  - 'cancelUpgrade': is used to cancel and back out of a system
                  software upgrade operation in progress and can be used before
                  the cmmtUpgrade action is called.
                  - 'invokeScpUpgrade': is a special-purpose upgrade step used
                  in place of the invkUpgrade value when an upgrade is being
                  performed on an SCP pack only. Such a targeted upgrade is
                  valid only when an SCP pack is replaced and the new pack
                  requires a software upgrade to make its software version
                  consistent with the system
                  
                  In order for the set request on the swUpgradeCmd object to
                  complete successfully, the values of other objects must be set
                  in the same set request for some of the commands. The
                  additional objects required to be set along with the
                  swUpgradeCmd object for each SwUpgradeCmd value are listed
                  below.

                  the ftp or sftp server with the upgrade load files is to 
                  be found, along with access parameters.
                  - invokeUpgrade, invokeScpUpgrade: must also set the
                  swUpgradeInvokeRelNum object to confirm the software version
                  that is to be used in the upgrade. The swUpgradeCheckAlm
                  object may be set, but is not mandatory.

DataCommsPingCmd ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION  "The DataCommsPingCmd textual convention is the value of the
                  dataCommsPingCmd object which is used to perform a ping
                  operation over the NE's OSC. The operation is initiated when a
                  set request is performed on the dataCommsPingCmd object with a
                  value corresponding to the ping action, as explained below.
                  
                  The valid values for DataCommsPingCmd that can be used in a
                  set operation are:
                  - 'ping', used to trigger the ping operation over the OSC
                  
                  A value of 'pingInProgress' is returned when the
                  dataCommsPingCmd object is read in a get operation if the ping
                  command entered has not yet completed, otherwise 'noOp' is
                  returned.
                  
                  In order for the set request on a DataCommsPingCmd object to
                  complete successfully, the dataCommsPingCmd object, along with
                  the dataCommdPingAddress and optionally the
                  dataCommsPingNumAttemps objects must be set in the same set
                  
                  request for a given row of the table. The purpose of these
                  objects is:
                  - dataCommsPingAddress: indicates the IP Address which is the
                  target of the ping operation
                  - dataCommsPingNumAttempts: indicates how many ping attempts
                  are to be made in the ping operation
                  
                  Once the dataCommsPingCmd operation is completed by way of the
                  set operation on the dataCommsPingCmd and associated objects,
                  the result of the operation is checked by performing a get
                  operation on the dataCommsPingNumSuccesses object. When the
                  ping operation completes, the value of this object will be set
                  to the number of the attempted ping trials that resulted in a
                  successful ping."

-- The event trap types, as described in the BTI-7000-MIB, are against equipment
-- (such as, shelf, circuit pack and transceivers) and entities (such as, amplifiers and
-- Optical Supervisory Channel).
-- 
-- The trap notifications as defined in the BTI-7000-MIB include the following
-- information:
-- � Notification type (also known as Trap type in SNMPv1)� the name of the trap
-- as it appears in the BTI-7000-MIB
-- � Objects (also known as Variables in SNMPv1)� additional data values
-- embedded in the trap notification that carry data pertinent to the trap event
-- � Description - a general description of the meaning of the trap event
-- � Notification OID (also known as the combined Enterprise and Trap fields in
-- SNMPv1) - the notification object identifier is a string of numbers used to
-- identify objects, in this case traps, defined in the BTI-7000-MIB

            'notification-event' is the transmission of a single
