     DESCRIPTION
         "This MIB contains managed object definitions for
          encapsulating TDM (T1,E1, T3, E3, NxDS0) as
          pseudo-wires over packet-switching networks (PSN).

          This MIB supplements the PW-STD-MIB as in: Zelig, D.,
          Nadeau,T. 'Pseudo Wire (PW) Management Information Base'.
          The PW-STD-MIB contains structures and MIB associations
          generic to Pseudo-Wire (PW) emulation. PW-specific
          MIBs (such as this) contain config and stats for specific
          PW types.
