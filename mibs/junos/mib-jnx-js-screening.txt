            "Teardrop attacks exploit the reassembly of fragmented IP 
             packets. In the IP header, one of the fields is the fragment 
             offset field, which indicates one of the fields is the fragment 
             offset field.  It indicates the starting position of the data 
             contained in a fragmented packet relative to the data of the 
             original unfragmented packet. When the sum of the offset and 
             size of one fragmented packet differ from that of the next

             to reassemble the packet can crash, especially if it is running 
             an older operating system that has this vulnerability.

             discrepancy in a fragmented packet and drops it and this

            "The maximum allowable IP packet size is 65,535 bytes, 
             including the packet header (typically 20 bytes long). 
             An ICMP echo request is an IP packet with a pseudo header, 
             which is 8 bytes long. Therefore, the maximum allowable 
             size of the data area of an ICMP echo request is 65,507 
             bytes. 

             However, many ping implementations allow the user to specify 
             a packet size larger than 65,507 bytes. A grossly oversized 
             ICMP packet can trigger a range of adverse system reactions 
             such as denial of service (DoS), crashing, freezing, and 
             rebooting.   

             When the Ping Death option is enabled, the device detects and 
             rejects such oversized and irregular packet sizes even when 
             the attacker hides the total packet size by purposefully 
             fragmenting it.

        DESCRIPTION
            "One method to gain access to a restricted network is to insert 
             a bogus source address in the packet header to make the packet 
             appear to come from a trusted source. This technique is called 
             IP spoofing. The mechanism to detect IP spoofing relies on 
             route table entries. 
                
             For example, if a packet with source IP address 10.1.1.6 arrives 
             at port eth3, but the device has a route to 10.1.1.0/24 through 
             port eth1. IP spoofing checking notes that this address arrived 
             at an invalid interface as defined in the route table. A valid
             packet from 10.1.1.6 can only arrive via eth1, not eth3.  The 
             device concludes that the packet has a spoofed source IP address 
             and discards it.
