JuniEnable ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

    DESCRIPTION

        'enable' and 'disable'.  Used for both admin (configurable) and oper
        (read-only) objects."

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A virtual router text name of restricted length.  Represents textual
        information taken from the NVT ASCII graphics character set (codes 32
        through 126)."

        textual information taken from the NVT ASCII graphics character set
        (codes 32 through 126)."

    SYNTAX      OCTET STRING (SIZE(0..32))

JuniNextIfIndex ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Coordinate ifIndex value allocation for entries in an associated
        ifIndex-ed interface table, by first reading an ifIndex value from this
        object, then creating an entry, having that ifIndex value, in the
        associated interface table.

        The DESCRIPTION clause for an object of this type must identify the
        associated interface table.

        A GET of this object returns the next available ifIndex value to be used
        to create an entry in the associated interface table; or zero, if no
        valid ifIndex value is available.  This object also returns a value of
        zero when it is the lexicographic successor of a varbind presented in an
        SNMP GETNEXT or GETBULK request, for which circumstance it is assumed
        that ifIndex allocation is unintended.

        Successive GETs will typically return different values, thus avoiding
        collisions among cooperating management clients seeking to create table
        entries simultaneously.

        Unless specified otherwise by its MAX-ACCESS and DESCRIPTION clauses, an
        object of this type is read-only, and a SET of such an object returns a
        notWritable error."
    SYNTAX      Integer32 (0..2147483647)

JuniIpAddrLessIf ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Compressed index representation to identify both numbered and
        unnumbered ('address-less') IP subnetworks.

        One approach is to identify such interfaces with a 2-tuple consisting of
        <IpAddress, ifIndex>, where only one of the pair is nonzero for a valid
        interface (IpAddress is nonzero for numbered interfaces, ifIndex is
        nonzero for unnumbered interfaces).

        As an alternative, this textual convention compresses the 2-tuple
        information into an IpAddress (32-bit) format a.b.c.d having the
        following interpretation:

        Format              Interpretation      IP Interface Type
        ------------------------------------------------------------------
        0.0.0.0             'null' value        'none' or 'wildcard', etc.
        a.b.c.d, a != 0     IP Address          Numbered
        0.b.c.d             ifIndex             Unnumbered

        For the unnumbered case, the value of the ifIndex is given by
        (b * 65536) + (c * 256) + (d)

        A side-effect of this approach is that ifIndex values for IP network
        interfaces must fall in the range 1..16777215 (i.e. 24 bits)."
    SYNTAX      IpAddress

JuniTimeSlotMap ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A bit map representing one or more timeslots of a DS1/E1 interface.
        Bits are numbered in descending order from 31-0 starting from the most
        significant bit of the first octet and ending with the least significant
        bit of the fourth octet.  Bits 1-24 are relevant for DS1 interfaces,
        bits 0-31 are relevant for E1 interfaces.

        associated timeslot is not in use."

JuniAcctngAdminType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

    DESCRIPTION
        "The desired administrative state for the collection of accounting

        JuniAcctngAdminType is defined in the MIB OBJECT description that uses
        this type."

                    enabled(1) }

JuniAcctngOperType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "The operational state for the collection of accounting records.  The
        administrative domain that an object of this type is reporting state
        for, is defined in the MIB object description that uses this type.

        The notSupported(2) state indicates that accounting data collection is
        not supported for the entity using an object of JuniAcctngOperType type.
        If an entity does not support accounting data collection, an object of
        JuniAcctngOperType type will report notSupported(2) regardless of the
        value set in the corresponding JuniAcctngAdminType.

        The disabled(0) state indicates that the corresponding
        JuniAcctngAdminType object has been set to disabled(0).  If a data
        collection is in process, the value of JuniAcctngOperType will change to
        disabled(0) after the current collection completes.

        The enabled(1) state indicates that the corresponding
        JuniAcctngAdminType object has been set to enabled(1) and that the
        entity is ready to collect accounting records."
    SYNTAX      INTEGER {

JuniLogSeverity ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

    DESCRIPTION
        "The log severity level.

        Lower numerical values correspond to higher severity levels.  The value
        'off' filters all severity levels."
    SYNTAX      INTEGER {

                    debug(7) }

JuniSetMap ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A bitmap indicating which objects in a table entry have been explicitly
        configured.

        A 1 in a bit position indicates the corresponding table entry object has
        been explicitly configured.

        A 0 in a bit position indicates the corresponding table entry has NOT
        been explicitly configured (and typically contains the default setting
        defined in the DEFVAL clause for that object).

        Once set, a bit typically remains set until the table entry is
        destroyed.  The semantics of an object of this type should specify by
        what circumstances, if any, bits in the map may be cleared.

        If an entry exists in a table but no entry objects have been configured,
        JuniSetMap will contain a zero-length string.

        The DESCRIPTION clause for an object having this SYNTAX should indicate
        which, if any, entry objects are excluded from representation in the
        JuniSetMap.  Typically, index and RowStatus entry objects would not be
        represented.

        Bit positions correspond to table entry objects as follows:  Objects in
        the table entry are numbered according to the last OID subidentifier of
        their object type as defined in the MIB.  For example, an object in a
        table entry having OID 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.5 would be object number
        5. (Instance-identifying OID subidentifiers are ignored.)

        Octets in the map are numbered 1..N beginning with the first octet.

        Bits in an octet are numbered 1..8 beginning with the MOST significant
        bit.

        Bit B in octet Q represents the entry object numbered E thus:
            E = (((Q - 1) * 8) + B)

        For example, the third most significant bit in the second octet
        represents the entry object numbered 11:
            ((((2 - 1) * 8) + 3) = 11

        Conversely, the octet Q and bit B positions of the corresponding bit for
        a given entry object numbered E is determined by:
            Q = (((E - 1) / 8) + 1)     (where '/' means integer division)
            B = (((E - 1) modulo 8) + 1)

        For example, the octet and bit positions of the entry object numbered 11
        are:
            (((11 - 1) / 8) + 1)      = 2 (octet number)
            (((11 - 1) modulo 8) + 1) = 3 (3rd most sig. bit) "
    SYNTAX      OCTET STRING (SIZE(0..8))

        Examples:  3/0, 12/0/1, 0/0 

        The form is determined by the physical architecture of the router
        platform.  E.g., the ERX family of platforms (first generation E-series)
