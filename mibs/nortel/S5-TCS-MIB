SrcIndx ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
         "A textual convention for an Index of a 'source'.
         The values are encoded so that the same MIB object
         can be used to describe the same type of data, but
         from different sources.
         For the 5000 Chassis, this is encoded in the
         following base 10 fields:
           1bbiii - identifies an interface on an NMM
                      where 'bb' is the board index and
                      'iii' is the interface number.
        
           2bbppp - identifies a connectivity port on
                      a board where 'bb' is the board INDEX
                      and 'ppp' is the port INDEX.
        
           3bblll - identifies a local channel on a
                      board where 'bb' is the board INDEX
                      and 'll' is the local channel INDEX.
        
           4bbccc - identifies a cluster on a board
                      where 'bb' is the board INDEX and
                      'cc' is the cluster INDEX.
        
           5bbfff - identifies a FPU on a board where
                      'bb' is the board INDEX, and 'fff' is
                      the FPU INDEX.
        
           6bbnnn - identifies host board backplane counters
                      where 'bb' is the board INDEX, and
                      'nnn' is the segment INDEX.
        
           7bbccc - identifies a NULL segment on a board
                      where 'bb' is the board INDEX, and
                      'ccc' is the cluster INDEX.
        
           8mmnnn - identifies a sum across all host board(s)
                      connected to a given backplane segment
                      where 'mm' is media type, and 'nnn' is
                      the segment INDEX. (NOTE: This is currently
                      only valid for Ethernet.)"
    SYNTAX      INTEGER (1..999999)

MediaType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
         "A textual convention for Media types"
    SYNTAX      INTEGER {
	other(1),	-- unknown or other type
	eth(2),		-- ethernet
	tok(3),		-- token ring
	fddi(4)		-- FDDI
	}		-- ATM later

FddiBkNetMode ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION

	thruLow(2),
	thruHigh(3),
	thruLowThruHigh(4)
	}

BkNetId ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
         "The backplane network ID. This is a numeric assignment
         made to a backplane channel, a piece of a divided
         backplane channel, or a grouping of several backplane
         channels (which is done for FDDI). The number (and values)
         of the backplane networks is determined by the setting
         of the channel divider(s) which split some or all
         the backplane channels into networks, and by
         grouping when allowed by the media (such as FDDI).
         Different media and backplane implementations may
         have a divider or not. Also, there may be different
         mappings of backplane network IDs to a divided (or
         undivided) backplane channel.
        
         Note to agent implementors - you must map the divided
         (or undivided) backplane channel to the numbering here
         based on the setting of the backplane channel divider(s),
         and/or the grouping of the channels for FDDI."
    SYNTAX      INTEGER (1..255)

BkChan ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
         "The physical backplane channel identification.
         This does not change when a backplane is divided.
         A value of zero means no channel. Otherwise, the
         channels are numbered starting at one."
    SYNTAX      INTEGER (0..255)

LocChan ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
         "The physical local channel identification.
         A value of zero means no channel. Otherwise, the
         channels are numbered starting at one."
    SYNTAX      INTEGER (0..255)

AttId ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
         "The attachment ID. This is either a backplane
         network ID, a local channel, or as an indication
         of no backplane network attachment. Negative numbers
         are used to identify local channels on a board.
         Where used, the board must also be specified
         (or implied). A value of zero is used to indicate
         no (or null) attachment. Positive numbers are the
         backplane network IDs. The number (and values) of
         the backplane networks is determined by the setting
         of the channel divider(s) which split some or all
         the backplane channels into backplane networks,
         and by grouping when allowed by the media (such as
         FDDI). Different media and implementations may have
         a divider or not. Also, there may be different
         mappings of backplane network IDs to a divided
         (or undivided) backplane channel.
        
         Note to agent implementors - you must map the divided
         (or undivided) backplane channel to the numbering here
         based on the setting of the backplane channel divider(s),
         and/or the grouping of the channels for FDDI."
