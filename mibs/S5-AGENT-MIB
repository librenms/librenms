          "This object is used to control whether the device uses the Simple
           Network Time Protocol (SNTP), to synchronize the device's clock to
           the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

           If the value is disabled(1), the device will not synchronize it's
           clock using SNTP.

           If the value is unicast(2), the device will first synchronize
           shortly after boot time when network access becomes available,
           and periodically thereafter, as specified by the value of
           s5AgSntpSyncInterval.  If the value is not unicast(2) at boot,
           the device will synchronize when the value is first set to
           unicast(2), and periodically thereafter.  
           
           Synchronization process: 
           This process applies to automatic (periodic) and manual
           synchronization attempts.  The device will first attempt to
           synchronize with the primary NTP server as defined by
           s5AgSntpPrimaryServerAddress (if non-zero).  If the primary
           server synchonization is attempted and fails, the
           s5AgSntpPrimaryServerSyncFailures counter is incremented. The
           device will then attempt to synchronize with the secondary NTP
           server as defined by s5AgSntpSecondaryServerAddress (if non-zero).
           If the secondary server synchronization is attempted and fails,
           the s5AgSntpSecondaryServerSyncFailures counter is incremented.
           If synchronization succeeds with either server, the
           s5AgSntpLastSyncTime and s5AgSntpLastSyncSource values are
           updated.  The s5AgSntpNextSyncTime value is updated on success
           or failure. For the special case of first sync failures, the
           system will automatically retry every few minutes until
           synchronization is achieved without regard to
