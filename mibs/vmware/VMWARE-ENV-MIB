DESCRIPTION
     "This MIB module identifies hardware components of a machine as provided by IPMI.
      The descriptions in this document will be marked with [1] to refer the IPMI specification here:
      https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/product-briefs/ipmi-second-gen-interface-spec-v2-rev1-1.pdf
      which provides a definition for IPMI System Event Log (SEL).
     "

REVISION   "201705300000Z"
DESCRIPTION
    "This revision deprecates the previous CIM based implementation. The vmwEnvTable now maps
     directly to an IPMI System Event Log allowing for simpler identification and management.
     vmwEnvSource.0 will now report ipmi(4) on agents implementing this mib module version."

REVISION   "201005120000Z"
DESCRIPTION
    "This revision adds support for CIM OMC_IpmiAlertIndication as the source of events
     instead of only IPMI sensors thus more areas of hardware can be reported on.
     This required a new notification set to be defined replacing previous
     notifications."

REVISION   "200810300000Z"
DESCRIPTION
    "Introduce vmwESXNotification to match ESX 3.5 agent."
