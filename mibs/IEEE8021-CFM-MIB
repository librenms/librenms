        Implementations MUST ensure that Dot1agCfmMaintDomainNameType

        In particular,

Dot1agCfmMaintDomainName ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
       "Denotes a generic Maintenance Domain Name.

        A Dot1agCfmMaintDomainName value is always interpreted within
        the context of a Dot1agCfmMaintDomainNameType value.  Every
        usage of the Dot1agCfmMaintDomainName textual convention is
        required to specify the Dot1agCfmMaintDomainNameType object
        that provides the context.  It is suggested that the
        Dot1agCfmMaintDomainNameType object be logically registered
        before the object(s) that use the Dot1agCfmMaintDomainName
        textual convention, if they appear in the same logical row.

        The value of a Dot1agCfmMaintDomainName object MUST always
        be consistent with the value of the associated
        Dot1agCfmMaintDomainNameType object. Attempts to set
        an Dot1agCfmMaintDomainName object to a value inconsistent
        with the associated Dot1agCfmMaintDomainNameType MUST fail
        with an inconsistentValue error.

        When this textual convention is used as the syntax of an
        index object, there may be issues with the limit of 128
        sub-identifiers specified in SMIv2, IETF STD 58.  In this
        case, the object definition MUST include a 'SIZE' clause
        to limit the number of potential instance sub-identifiers;
        otherwise the applicable constraints MUST be stated in
        the appropriate conceptual row DESCRIPTION clauses, or
        in the surrounding documentation if there is no single
        DESCRIPTION clause that is appropriate.

        A value of none(1) in the associated
        Dot1agCfmMaintDomainNameType object means that no Maintenance
        Domain name is present, and the contents of the
        Dot1agCfmMaintDomainName object are meaningless.

        See the DESCRIPTION of the Dot1agCfmMaintAssocNameType
        TEXTUAL-CONVENTION for a discussion of the length limits on
        the Maintenance Domain name and Maintenance Association name.

        received from the last MEP. It indicates the ability of the
        Bridge Port on which the transmitting MEP resides to pass
        ordinary data, regardless of the status of the MAC
        (Table 21-10).

        psNoPortStateTLV(0) Indicates either that no CCM has been
                            received or that no port status TLV was
                            present in the last CCM received.

        psBlocked(1)        Ordinary data cannot pass freely through
                            the port on which the remote MEP resides.
                            Value of enableRmepDefect is equal to
                            false.

                            Value of enableRmepDefect is equal to
                            true.

        NOTE: A 0 value is used for psNoPortStateTLV, so that
              additional code points can be added in a manner
              consistent with the Dot1agCfmInterfaceStatus textual
              convention.

                          was present in the last CCM received.

    isUp(1)               The interface is ready to pass packets.

    isDown(2)             The interface cannot pass packets

    isTesting(3)          The interface is in some test mode.
   
    isUnknown(4)          The interface status cannot be determined
                          for some reason.

    isDormant(5)          The interface is not in a state to pass
                          packets but is in a pending state, waiting
                          for some external event.
    
    isNotPresent(6)       Some component of the interface is missing

       variable and uses the (non-zero) value read when creating a
       new row with an SNMP SET.  When the SET is performed, the
       Command Responder (agent) MUST determine whether the value is
       indeed still unused; Two Network Management Applications may
       attempt to create a row (configuration entry) simultaneously
       and use the same value. If it is currently unused, the SET
       succeeds and the Command Responder (agent) changes the value
       of this object, according to an implementation-specific
       algorithm.  If the value is in use, however, the SET fails.
       The Network Management Application MUST then re-read this
       variable to obtain a new usable value.

       An OBJECT-TYPE definition using this SYNTAX MUST specify the
       relevant table for which the object is providing this
       functionality.

        can vary from Bridge component to Bridge component is contained
        in the dot1agCfmMaCompTable.

        Creation of a Service Instance establishes a connectionless
        association among the selected DSAPs.  Configuring a
        Maintenance association Endpoint (MEP) at each of the
        DSAPs creates a Maintenance Association (MA) to monitor
        that connectionless connectivity.  The MA is identified by a
        Short MA Name that is unique within the Maintenance Domain
        and chosen to facilitate easy identification of the Service
        Instance.  Together, the Maintenance Domain Name and the
        Short MA Name form the Maintenance Association Identifier

        incorrect connectivity among Service Instances.  A small

    DESCRIPTION
       "List of MEPIDs that belong to this MA.
 
        12.14.6.1.3 specifies that a list of MEPIDs in all
        Bridges in that MA, but since SNMP SMI does not allow to
        state in a MIB that an object in a table is an array, the 
        information has to be stored in another table with two
        indices, being the first index, the index of the table that 
        contains the list or array.

        For all Bridges in which the same MAID {dot1agCfmMdFormat,
        dot1agCfmMdName, dot1agCfmMaNetFormat, and dot1agCfmMaNetName}
        is configured, the same set of dot1agCfmMaMepListIdentifiers
        MUST be configured in the Bridges' dot1agCfmMaMepListTables.
        This allows each MEP to determine whether or not it is
        receiving CCMs from all of the other MEPs in the MA.

        For example, if one were creating a new MA whose MAID were
        {charString, 'Dom1', charString, 'MA1'}, that had 2 MEPs, whose
        MEPIDs were 1 and 3, one could, in Bridge A:
         1. Get a new MD index d from dot1agCfmMdTableNextIndex.
         2. Create the Maintenance Domain {charString, 'Dom1'}.
         3. Get a new MA index a from dot1agCfmMdMaNextIndex [d].
         4. Create the Maintenance Association {charString, 'MA1'}.
         5. Create a new dot1agCfmMaMepListEntry for each of the MEPs
            in the MA: [d, a, 1] and [d, a, 3].
         6. Create one of the new MEPs, say [d, a, 1].
        Then, in Bridge B:
         7. Do all of these steps 1-6, except for using the other MEPID
            for the new MEP in Step 6, in this example, MEPID 3.
        Note that, when creating the MA, MEP List Table, and MEP
        entries in the second Bridge, the indices 'd' and 'a'
        identifying the MAID {charString, 'Dom1', charString, 'MA1'}
        may have different values than those in the first Bridge.

    MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
       "The Maintenance Association Endpoint (MEP) table.

        Each row in the table represents a different MEP.  A MEP is
        an actively managed CFM entity, associated with a specific
        DSAP of a Service Instance, which can generate and receive
        CFM PDUs and track any responses.  It is an endpoint of a
        single Maintenance Association, and is an endpoint of a
        separate Maintenance Entity for each of the other MEPs in
        the same Maintenance Association (3.132).

        This table uses three indices. The first two indices are the
        indices of the Maintenance Domain and MA tables, the reason
        being that a MEP is always related to an MA and Maintenance
        Domain.

        The MEP table also stores all the managed objects for sending
        LBM and LTM.

        *LBM Managed objects

        LBM Managed objects in the MEP table
        enables the management entity to initiate
        transmission of Loopback messages.  It will signal the MEP
        that it SHOULD transmit some number of Loopback messages
        and detect the detection (or lack thereof) of the
        corresponding Loopback messages.

        Steps to use entries in this table:

        1) Wait for dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus value to be
           false.  To do this do this sequence:
           a. an SNMP GET for both SnmpSetSerialNo and
              dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus objects (in same SNMP
              PDU).
           b. Check if value for dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus is false.
              - if not, wait x seconds, go to step a above.
              - if yes, save the value of SnmpSetSerialNo and go
                to step 2) below
        2) Change dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus value from false to
           true to ensure no other management entity will use
           the service. In order to not disturb a possible other NMS
           do this by sending an SNMP SET for both SnmpSetSerialNo
           and dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus objects (in same SNMP
           PDU,  and make sure SNmpSetSerialNo is the first varBind).
           For the SnmpSetSerialNo varBind, use the value that you
           obtained in step 1)a.. This ensures that two cooperating
           NMSes will not step on each others toes.
           Setting this MIB object does not set the corresponding
           LBIactive state machine variable.
        3) Setup the different data to be sent (number of messages,
           optional TLVs,...), except do not set
           dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmMessages.
        4) Record the current values of dot1agCfmMepLbrIn,
           dot1agCfmMepLbrInOutOfOrder, and dot1agCfmMepLbrBadMsdu.
        6) Set dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmMessages to a non-zero value to
           initiate transmission of Loopback messages.
           The dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmMessages indicates the
           number of LBMs to be sent and is not decremented as
           loopbacks are actually sent. dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmMessages
           is not equivalent to the LBMsToSend state machine variable.
        7) Check the value of dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmResultOK to
           find out if the operation was successfully initiated or
           not.
        8) Monitor the value of dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus.
           When it is reset to false, the last LBM has been transmitted.
           Wait an additional 5 seconds to ensure that all LBRs have
           been returned.
        9) Compare dot1agCfmMepLbrIn, dot1agCfmMepLbrInOutOfOrder,
           and dot1agCfmMepLbrBadMsdu to their old values from step
           4, above, to get the results of the test.

        *LTM Managed objects
        The LTM Managed objects in the MEP table are used in a manner
        similar to that described for LBM transmission, above. A SET
        operation to the variable dot1agCfmMepTransmitLtmFlags
        triggers the transmission of an LTM. Then, the variables
        dot1agCfmMepTransmitLtmSeqNumber and
        dot1agCfmMepTransmitLtmEgressIdentifier return the information
        required to recover the results of the LTM from the
        dot1agCfmLtrTable.

                }
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
       "A MEP has a persistent defect condition. A notification
        (fault alarm) is sent to the management entity with the OID
        of the MEP that has detected the fault.

        Whenever a MEP has a persistent defect,
        it may or may not generate a Fault Alarm to warn the system
        administrator of the problem, as controlled by the MEP
        Fault Notification Generator State Machine and associated
        Managed Objects. Only the highest-priority defect, as shown
        in Table 20-1, is reported in the Fault Alarm.

        If a defect with a higher priority is raised after a Fault
        Alarm has been issued, another Fault Alarm is issued.

        The management entity receiving the notification can identify
        the system from the network source address of the
        notification, and can identify the MEP reporting the defect
        by the indices in the OID of the dot1agCfmMepHighestPrDefect
        variable in the notification:

           dot1agCfmMdIndex - Also the index of the MEP's
                              Maintenance Domain table entry
                              (dot1agCfmMdTable).
           dot1agCfmMaIndex - Also an index (with the MD table index)
                              of the MEP's Maintenance Association
                              network table entry
                              (dot1agCfmMaNetTable), and (with the MD
                              table index and component ID) of the
                              MEP's MA component table entry
                              (dot1agCfmMaCompTable).
           dot1agCfmMepIdentifier - MEP Identifier and final index
                              into the MEP table (dot1agCfmMepTable).
