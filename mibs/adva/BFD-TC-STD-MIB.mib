DESCRIPTION
    "UDP destination port number of BFD control packets.

     4784 represents multi-hop BFD session.
     6784 represents BFD on Link Aggregation Group (LAG) session.

     However, syntax is left open to wider range of values
     purposely for two reasons:
     1. Implementation uses non-compliant port number for
        valid proprietary reason.
     2. Potential future extension documents.





     The value of 0 is a special, reserved value used
     to indicate special conditions and should not be considered
     a valid port number."
