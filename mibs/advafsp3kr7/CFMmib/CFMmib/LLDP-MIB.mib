    DESCRIPTION
            "This TC describes the source of a chassis identifier.

            The enumeration 'chassisComponent(1)' represents a chassis
            identifier based on the value of entPhysicalAlias object
            (defined in IETF RFC 2737) for a chassis component (i.e.,
            an entPhysicalClass value of 'chassis(3)').

            The enumeration 'interfaceAlias(2)' represents a chassis
            identifier based on the value of ifAlias object (defined in
            IETF RFC 2863) for an interface on the containing chassis.

            The enumeration 'portComponent(3)' represents a chassis
            identifier based on the value of entPhysicalAlias object
            (defined in IETF RFC 2737) for a port or backplane
            component (i.e., entPhysicalClass value of 'port(10)' or
            'backplane(4)'), within the containing chassis.

            The enumeration 'macAddress(4)' represents a chassis
            identifier based on the value of a unicast source address
            (encoded in network byte order and IEEE 802.3 canonical bit
            order), of a port on the containing chassis as defined in
            IEEE Std 802-2001.

            The enumeration 'networkAddress(5)' represents a chassis
            identifier based on a network address, associated with
            a particular chassis.  The encoded address is actually
            composed of two fields.  The first field is a single octet,
            representing the IANA AddressFamilyNumbers value for the
            specific address type, and the second field is the network
            address value.

    DESCRIPTION
            "The counter that represents the number of age-outs that
            occurred on a given port.  An age-out is the number of
            times the complete set of information advertised by a
            particular MSAP has been deleted from tables contained in
            lldpRemoteSystemsData and lldpExtensions objects because
            the information timeliness interval has expired.

            This counter is similar to lldpStatsRemTablesAgeouts, except
            that the counter is on a per port basis.  This enables NMS to
            poll tables associated with the lldpRemoteSystemsData objects
            and all LLDP extension objects associated with remote systems
            on the indicated port only.

            This counter should be set to zero during agent initialization
            and its value should not be saved in non-volatile storage.
            When a port's admin status changes from 'disabled' to
            'rxOnly', 'txOnly' or 'txAndRx', the counter associated with
            the same port should reset to 0.  The agent should also flush
            all remote system information associated with the same port.

            This counter should be incremented only once when the
            complete set of information is invalidated (aged out) from
            all related tables on a particular port.  Partial aging
            is not allowed, and thus, should not change the value of
            this counter."

    DESCRIPTION
            "This table contains one or more rows per physical network
            connection known to this agent.  The agent may wish to ensure
            that only one lldpRemEntry is present for each local port,
            or it may choose to maintain multiple lldpRemEntries for
            the same local port.

            The following procedure may be used to retrieve remote
            systems information updates from an LLDP agent:

               1. NMS polls all tables associated with remote systems
                  and keeps a local copy of the information retrieved.
                  NMS polls periodically the values of the following
                  objects:
                     a. lldpStatsRemTablesInserts
                     b. lldpStatsRemTablesDeletes
                     c. lldpStatsRemTablesDrops
                     d. lldpStatsRemTablesAgeouts
                     e. lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal for all ports.

               2. LLDP agent updates remote systems MIB objects, and
                  sends out notifications to a list of notification
                  destinations.

               3. NMS receives the notifications and compares the new
                  values of objects listed in step 1.  

                  Periodically, NMS should poll the object
                  lldpStatsRemTablesLastChangeTime to find out if anything
                  has changed since the last poll.  if something has
                  changed, NMS will poll the objects listed in step 1 to
                  figure out what kind of changes occurred in the tables.

                  if value of lldpStatsRemTablesInserts has changed,
                  then NMS will walk all tables by employing TimeFilter
                  with the last-polled time value.  This request will
                  return new objects or objects whose values are updated
                  since the last poll.

                  if value of lldpStatsRemTablesAgeouts has changed,
                  then NMS will walk the lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal and
                  compare the new values with previously recorded ones.
                  For ports whose lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal value is
                  greater than the recorded value, NMS will have to
                  retrieve objects associated with those ports from
                  table(s) without employing a TimeFilter (which is
                  performed by specifying 0 for the TimeFilter.)
