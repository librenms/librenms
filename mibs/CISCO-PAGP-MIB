        DESCRIPTION
            "The MIB module for configuration of Fast Etherchannel
            and the operation of the Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP).
            These features allow two or more physical interfaces to
            be aggregated together to form a single agport.  This
            agport behaves like a single interface with improved
            bandwidth and/or availability over each of its component
            physical interfaces.

            You can monitor interfaces, agports, and related statistics
            through the ifStackTable and ifTable entries."

PagpGroupCapability ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
        "The group-capability value of an interface.  Indicates the
        ability of the interface to aggregate together with other
        interfaces to form aggregate links, or agports.

        The value of PagpGroupCapability has no meaning except by
        comparison (equal or not equal) to other PagpGroupCapability
        values for different interfaces (ifIndex values) having the
        same device (pagpDeviceId).  If two different interfaces on the
        same device have the same PagpGroupCapability, then they are
        capable of being aggregated into the same agport.  If they
        have different PagpGroupCapability values, then they cannot
        be aggregated together.

        The assignment of PagpGroupCapability values to the variables
        which use them can be made either by the network administrator
        or by the managed system, depending on the variable.  One
        easily-used and understood means of assigning
        PagpGroupCapability values is to use, for each interface's
        PagpGroupCapability, the lowest ifIndex (in numerical value)
        of all of the intefaces with which this interface can
        aggregate.  The use of this technique is not required.
        Therefore, when examining a variable using the
        PagpGroupCapability, the user must not assume that the values
        have any meaning, other than by comparison for equality with
        other interfaces' values on the same device.

        Note also that a single managed system may utilize multiple
        pagpDeviceId values.  PagpGroupCapability values may be
        compared only among those interfaces with the same
        pagpDeviceId values."

        The pagpOperGroupCapability values are adjusted automatically by

to

        pagpPhysGroupCapability on that same interface.

        A pagpAdminGroupCapability may be set to restrict which

        pagpAdminGroupCapability value that permits two interfaces to
        be aggregated together that are prohibited from being aggregated
        by the pagpPhysGroupCapability values will be refused.

        A given device may place consistency requirements on
        pagpAdminGroupCapability values that span multiple interfaces.
        For example, one may be changing interfaces 1-4 from group
        capabilities 1, 1, 1, 1 to group capabilities 1, 1, 3, 3.  The
        capability vector 1, 1, 3, 1 may be illegal.  The managed device
        will refuse a request to set a value in an interface's
        pagpAdminGroupCapability variable if: 1) that new value would
        result in an illegal combination of values; and 2) the interface
        being set does not have its pagpEthcOperationMode variable set
to
        off(1).

        The pagpEthcOperationMode variable may be used to avoid illegal
        combinations of pagpAdminGroupCapability values.  As long as a
        given interface's pagpEthcOperationMode is in the off state, any
        value may be set in that interface's pagpAdminGroupCapability
        variable.  In the above example, the third interface could be
        disabled, the 3 could be written to the third and fourth
        interfaces, and the third interfaces re-enabled.

        The operating manuals of the managed device must be consulted to
