RlPolicyQosMode ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS  current
    DESCRIPTION
         "The user can set the system to operate either in the Basic mode or in the Advanced mode.
          The setting of the mode applies to all ports in the system.
          configuring the system to work in the advanced mode,
          all setting for the basic mode are not in affect.
          For example, 802.1p is not available when operating in the advanced mode.
          When changing from basic mode to advanced mode and then back to basic mode,
          the user assignments in the basic mode are restored.
          Same for moving from advanced to basic and back again to advanced mode,
          here again the user assignments are kept.
          The different modes are mutually exclusive, i.e., only one can be
          active at a given time. For example, when configuring the system to work
          in the advanced mode, all setting for the basic mode are not in affect.
          This means that 802.1p is not available when operating in the advanced mode.
          When changing between modes (Basic, Advanced, Service, none), some of
          the user settings are reset to their default values. Specifically:
          1. When changing from the advanced mode to any other mode,
             the CCL definitions are lost.
          2. When changing from any mode to any other mode, the interface assignments:
             associated Policy map, trust mode of the Basic mode, shaper and scheduler
             settings are lost.
          3. When changing from service mode to any other mode, all service mode
             settings are lost.
          4. When changing to service mode, ACL are lost. The user is prompted if
             he wants to whether to import his active ACLs to the service mode.
          5. All other user configurations are kept.
          When the system is configured to the Basic mode and the user changes the
          trust mode, the CCL assignment per port and the shaper settings are reset
          to their default values."
