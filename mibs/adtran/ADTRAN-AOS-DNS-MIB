AdDnsRequestErrorConditionTC  ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Indicates which specific error condition occurred. Error codes 0-15 are
        the RCODE error codes, while 16-n are Adtran proprietary DNS Request
        error conditions.
        
        The noError(0) state indicates that there is no error condition.
        
        The formatError(1) state indicates that name server was unable to interpret the
        query.
        
        The serverFailure(2) state indicates that  name server was unable to process this
         query due to a problem with the name server.
        
        The nameError(3) state indicates that the domain name referenced in the query does 
        not exist.  Meaningful only for responses from an authoritative name server.
        
        The notImplemented(4) state indicates that the  name server does not support
        the requested kind of query.
        
        The refused(5) state indicates the name server refuses to perform the specified 
        operation for policy reasons. For example, a name server may not wish to 
        provide the information to the particular requester, or a name server may
        not wish to perform a particular operation (e.g., zone transfer) for 
        particular data.
        
        The 6-15 states are reserved for future use.
        
        The unsuportedRCode(16) state indicates that the AOS unit does not support the
        RCODE (error condition) returned by the DNS sever.
        
        The malformedResponse(17) state indicates that AOS unit received an improperly
        formated data packet from the DNS server.
        
        The parseError(18) state indicates that AOS unit could not parse the data from
        the DNS server correctly.
        
        The timeoutWaitingForResponse(19) state indicates that AOS unit did not receive
        a response from DNS server in the predetermined waiting period.
        
        The emptyResponse(20) state indicates that the AOS unit received an empty
        response from the DNS server.  Many DNS servers send responses without any 
        answers as a form of failure.
        
        The unsupportedType(21) state indicates that the AOS unit does not support the
        qtype indicated in the DNS server's answer.
        
        The onlyRootAnswer(22) state indicates that the DNS server responded only with
        a '.' answer, the root domain. Per RFC2782 page 6, this is a failure.
        
        The portDeficiency(23) state indicates that the AOS unit failed to allocate
        an open port to send the DNS question to the DNS sever.
        
        The noServerConfigured(24) state indicates that the AOS unit does not have a
        DNS lookup server configured.
        
        The updSendError(25) state indicates that the AOS unit could not send the
        DNS question packet (maybe a routing issue with the configured name-server)."
