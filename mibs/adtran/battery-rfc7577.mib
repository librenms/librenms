batteryIdentifier OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX      SnmpAdminString
    MAX-ACCESS  read-only
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This object contains an identifier for the battery.

        Many manufacturers deliver not only simple batteries but
        battery packages including additional hardware and firmware.
        Typically, these modules include an identifier that can be
        retrieved by a device in which a battery has been installed.
        The identifier is useful when batteries are removed and
        reinstalled in the same or other devices.  Then, the device
        or the network management system can trace batteries and
        achieve continuity of battery monitoring.

        If the battery is identified by more than one value,
        for example, by a model number and a serial number,
        then the value of this object is a concatenation of these
        values, separated by the colon symbol ':'.  The values
        should be ordered so that a more significant value comes
        before a less significant one.  In the example above, the
        (more significant) model number would be first, and the serial
        number would follow: '<model number>:<serial number>'.

        If the battery identifier cannot be represented using the
        ISO/IEC IS 10646-1 character set, then a hexadecimal
        encoding of a binary representation of the entire battery
        identifier must be used.

        The value of this object must be an empty string if there
        is no battery identifier or if the battery identifier is
        unknown."

    DESCRIPTION
        "This object indicates the number of completed charging
        cycles that the battery underwent.  In line with the
        Smart Battery Data Specification Revision 1.1, a charging
        cycle is defined as the process of discharging the battery
        by a total amount equal to the battery design capacity as
        given by object batteryDesignCapacity.  A charging cycle
        may include several steps of charging and discharging the

        batteryDesignCapacity has been reached.  As soon as a
        charging cycle has been completed, the next one starts
        immediately, independent of the battery's current charge at
        the end of the cycle.

        For batteries of type primary(3), the value of this object is

    DESCRIPTION
        "This object indicates the current charging state of the
        battery.

        Value unknown(1) indicates that the charging state of the
        battery cannot be determined.

        Value charging(2) indicates that the battery is being
        charged in a way such that the charge of the battery
        increases.

        Value maintainingCharge(3) indicates that the battery is
        being charged with a low-average current that compensates
        self-discharging.  This includes trickle charging, float
        charging, and other methods for maintaining the current
        charge of a battery.  In typical implementations of charging
        controllers, state maintainingCharge(3) is only applied
        if the battery is fully charged or almost fully charged.

        Value noCharging(4) indicates that the battery is not being
        charged or discharged by electric current between the
        battery and electric circuits external to the battery.
        Note that the battery may still be subject to
        self-discharging.

        Value discharging(5) indicates that the battery is either
        used as the power source for electric circuits external to
        the battery or discharged intentionally by the
        charging controller, e.g., for the purpose of battery
        maintenance.  In any case, the charge of the battery

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "The value of this object indicates the desired
        charging state of the battery.  The real state is
        indicated by object batteryChargingOperState.  See the
        definition of object batteryChargingOperState for a
        description of the values.

        When this object is initialized by an implementation of the
        BATTERY-MIB module, its value is set to notSet(1).  In this
        case, the charging controller is free to choose which
        operational state is suitable.

        When the batteryChargingAdminState object is set, then the
        BATTERY-MIB implementation must try to set the battery
        to the indicated state.  The result will be indicated by
        object batteryChargingOperState.

        Setting object batteryChargingAdminState to value notSet(1)
        is a request to the charging controller to operate
        autonomously and choose the operational state that is
        suitable.

        Setting object batteryChargingAdminState to value charge(2)
        is a request to enter the operational state charging(2) until
        the battery is fully charged.  When the battery is fully
        charged, or if the battery was already fully charged or
        almost fully charged at the time of the request, the
        operational state will change to maintainingCharge(3) if the
        charging controller and the battery support the functionality
        of maintaining the charge, or it will change to noCharging(4)
        otherwise.

        Setting object batteryChargingAdminState to value
        doNotCharge(3) is a request for entering operational
        state noCharging(4).

        Setting object batteryChargingAdminState to value
        discharge(4) is a request for entering operational
        state discharging(5).  Discharging can be accomplished
        by ordinary use, applying a dedicated load, or any other
        means.  An example for applying this state is battery
        maintenance.  If the battery is empty or almost empty, the
        operational state will change to noCharging(4).
        The charging controller will decide which charge condition
        will be considered empty dependent on the battery
        technology used.  This is done to avoid damage on the
        battery due to deep discharge.

        Due to operational conditions and limitations of the
        implementation of the BATTERY-MIB module, changing the
        battery status according to a set value of object
        batteryChargingAdminState may not be possible.
        Setting the value of object batteryChargingAdminState
        may result in not changing the state of the battery
        to this value or even in setting the charging state
        to another value than the requested one.  For example,
        the charging controller might at any time decide to
        enter state discharging(5), if there is an operational need
        to use the battery for supplying power."

        "The value of this object identifies one or more cells of a
        battery.  The format of the cell identifier may vary between
        different implementations.  It should uniquely identify one
        or more cells of the indexed battery.

        This object can be used for batteries, such as lithium
        polymer batteries for which battery controllers monitor
        cells individually.

        This object is used by notifications of types
        batteryLowNotification, batteryTemperatureNotification,
        batteryCriticalNotification, and batteryAgingNotification.
        These notifications can use the value of this object to
        indicate the event that triggered the generation of the
        notification in more detail by specifying a single cell
        or a set of cells within the battery that is specifically
        addressed by the notification.

        An example use case for this object is a single cell in a
        battery that exceeds the temperature indicated by object
        batteryAlarmHighTemperature.  In such a case, a
        batteryTemperatureNotification can be generated that not
        only indicates the battery for which the temperature limit
        has been exceeded but also the particular cell.

        The initial value of this object is the empty string.  The
        value of this object is set each time a
        batteryLowNotification, batteryTemperatureNotification,
        batteryCriticalNotification, or batteryAgingNotification
        is generated.

        When a notification is generated that does not indicate a
        specific cell or set of cells, the value of this object is
        set to the empty string."

        than a write action to object batteryChargingAdminState.

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This notification can be generated when the current charge
        (batteryActualCharge) or the current voltage
        (batteryActualVoltage) of the battery falls below a
        threshold defined by object batteryAlarmLowCharge or object
        batteryAlarmLowVoltage, respectively.

        Note that, typically, this notification is generated in a
        state where the battery is still sufficiently charged to keep
        the device(s) that it powers operational for some time.
        If the charging state of the battery has become critical,
        i.e., the device(s) powered by the battery must go to a
        'sleep' or 'off' state, then the batteryCriticalNotification
        should be used instead.

        If the low charge or voltage has been detected for a single
        cell or a set of cells of the battery and not for the entire
        battery, then object batteryCellIdentifier should be set to
        a value that identifies the cell or set of cells.
        Otherwise, the value of object batteryCellIdentifier should
        be set to the empty string when this notification is
        generated.

        The notification should not be sent again for the same
        battery or cell before either (a) the current voltage or
        the current charge, respectively, has become higher than the
        corresponding threshold through charging or (b) an indication
        of a maintenance action has been detected, such as a battery
        disconnection event or a reinitialization of the battery
        monitoring system.

        This notification should not be sent when the battery is in
        a charging mode, i.e., the value of object
        batteryChargingOperState is charging(2)."

        "This notification can be generated when the current charge
        of the battery falls so low that it cannot provide a
        sufficient power supply function for regular operation
        of the powered device(s).  The battery needs to be charged
        before it can be used for regular power supply again.  The
        battery may still provide sufficient power for a 'sleep'
        mode of a powered device(s) or for a transition into an 'off'
        mode.

        If the critical state is caused by a single cell or a set of
        cells of the battery, then object batteryCellIdentifier
        should be set to a value that identifies the cell or set of
        cells.  Otherwise, the value of object batteryCellIdentifier

        generated.

        The notification should not be sent again for the same

        through charging to a non-critical value or an indication
        of a maintenance action has been detected, such as a battery
        disconnection event or a reinitialization of the battery
        monitoring system.

        This notification should not be sent when the battery is in

        If the low or high temperature has been detected for a
        single cell or a set of cells of the battery and not for the
        entire battery, then object batteryCellIdentifier should be
        set to a value that identifies the cell or set of cells.
        Otherwise, the value of object batteryCellIdentifier should
        be set to the empty string when this notification is
        generated.

        It may occur that the temperature alternates between values
        slightly below and slightly above a threshold.  For limiting
        the notification rate in such a case, this notification
        should not be sent again for the same battery or cell,
        respectively, within a time interval of 10 minutes.

        An exception to the rate limitations occurs immediately
        after the reinitialization of the battery monitoring system.
        At this point in time, if the battery temperature is above
