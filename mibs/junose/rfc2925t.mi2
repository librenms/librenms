    DESCRIPTION
       "To facilitate the provisioning of access control by a
       security administrator using the View-Based Access
       Control Model (RFC 2575, VACM) for tables in which
       multiple users may need to independently create or
       modify entries, the initial index is used as an 'owner
       index'.  Such an initial index has a syntax of
       SnmpAdminString, and can thus be trivially mapped to a
       securityName or groupName as defined in VACM, in
       accordance with a security policy.

       When used in conjunction with such a security policy
       all entries in the table belonging to a particular user
       (or group) will have the same value for this initial
       index.  For a given user's entries in a particular
       table, the object identifiers for the information in
       these entries will have the same subidentifiers (except
       for the 'column' subidentifier) up to the end of the
       encoded owner index. To configure VACM to permit access
       to this portion of the table, one would create
       vacmViewTreeFamilyTable entries with the value of
       vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree including the owner index
       portion, and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask 'wildcarding' the
       column subidentifier.  More elaborate configurations
       are possible."

        The value of this object must be a decimal integer
        in the range from 0 to 255.  This option can be used
        to determine what effect an explicit DS Field setting
        has on a traceroute response.  Not all values are legal
        or meaningful.  DS Field usage is often not supported
        by IP implementations.  A value of 0 means that the

        index values) traceRouteResultsTable,
        traceRouteProbeHistoryTable, and traceRouteHopsTable
        entries being deleted.

        A value MUST be specified for traceRouteCtlTargetAddress
        prior to a transition to active(1) state being
        accepted.

        Activation of a remote traceroute operation is
        controlled via traceRouteCtlAdminStatus and not
        by transitioning of this object's value to active(1).

        Transitions in and out of active(1) state are not
        allowed while an entry's traceRouteResultsOperStatus
        is active(1) with the exception that deletion of
        an entry in this table by setting its RowStatus
        object to destroy(6) will stop an active
        traceroute operation.

        The operational state of an traceroute operation
        can be determined by examination of the corresponding
        traceRouteResultsOperStatus object."

            are not capable of binding the send socket with a

            not supported return a 0 as the value of this object.
            A value of 0 implies that the function represented by
            this option is not supported."
