                 dsx1JBZS refers the Jammed Bit Zero Suppression,
                 in which the AT&T specification of at least one
                 pulse every 8 bit periods is literally implemented
                 by forcing a pulse in bit 8 of each channel.
                 Thus, only seven bits per channel, or 1.344 Mbps,
                 is available for data.

                 dsx1B8ZS refers to the use of a specified pattern
                 of normal bits and bipolar violations which are
                 used to replace a sequence of eight zero bits.

                 ANSI Clear Channels may use dsx1ZBTSI, or Zero
                 Byte Time Slot Interchange.

                 E1 links, with or without CRC, use dsx1HDB3 or
                 dsx1AMI.

                 dsx1AMI refers to a mode wherein no zero code
                 suppression is present and the line encoding does
                 not solve the problem directly.  In this
                 application, the higher layer must provide data
                 which meets or exceeds the pulse density
                 requirements, such as inverting HDLC data.

                 dsx1B6ZS refers to the user of a specifed pattern
                 of normal bits and bipolar violations which are
                 used to replace a sequence of six zero bits.  Used

                 information.

                 The dsx1LineStatus is a bit map represented as a
                 sum, therefore, it can represent multiple failures
                 (alarms) and a LoopbackState simultaneously.

                 dsx1NoAlarm must be set if and only if no other
                 flag is set.

                 If the dsx1loopbackState bit is set, the loopback
                 in effect can be determined from the
                 dsx1loopbackConfig object.
       The various bit positions are:

          DESCRIPTION
                 "This table is deprecated in favour of using
                 ifStackTable.

                 The table was mandatory for systems dividing a DS1
                 into channels containing different data streams
                 that are of local interest.  Systems which are
                 indifferent to data content, such as CSUs, need
                 not implement it.

                 The DS1 fractional table identifies which DS1
                 channels associated with a CSU are being used to
                 support a logical interface, i.e., an entry in the
                 interfaces table from the Internet-standard MIB.

                 For example, consider an application managing a
                 North American ISDN Primary Rate link whose
                 division is a 384 kbit/s H1 _B_ Channel for Video,
                 a second H1 for data to a primary routing peer,
                 and 12 64 kbit/s H0 _B_ Channels. Consider that
                 some subset of the H0 channels are used for voice
                 and the remainder are available for dynamic data
                 calls.

                 We count a total of 14 interfaces multiplexed onto
                 the DS1 interface. Six DS1 channels (for the sake
                 of the example, channels 1..6) are used for Video,
                 six more (7..11 and 13) are used for data, and the
                 remaining 12 are are in channels 12 and 14..24.

                 Let us further imagine that ifIndex 2 is of type
                 DS1 and refers to the DS1 interface, and that the
                 interfaces layered onto it are numbered 3..16.

                 We might describe the allocation of channels, in
                 the dsx1FracTable, as follows:
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 1 = 3  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.13 = 4
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 2 = 3  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.14 = 6
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 3 = 3  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.15 = 7
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 4 = 3  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.16 = 8
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 5 = 3  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.17 = 9
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 6 = 3  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.18 = 10
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 7 = 4  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.19 = 11
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 8 = 4  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.20 = 12
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 9 = 4  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.21 = 13
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2.10 = 4  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.22 = 14
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2.11 = 4  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.23 = 15
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2.12 = 5  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.24 = 16

                 For North American (DS1) interfaces, there are 24
                 legal channels, numbered 1 through 24.

                 For G.704 interfaces, there are 31 legal channels,
                 numbered 1 through 31.  The channels (1..31)
                 correspond directly to the equivalently numbered
                 time-slots."
