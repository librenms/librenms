    DESCRIPTION
       "To facilitate the provisioning of access control by a
       security administrator using the View-Based Access
       Control Model (RFC 2575, VACM) for tables in which
       multiple users may need to independently create or
       modify entries, the initial index is used as an 'owner
       index'.  Such an initial index has a syntax of
       SnmpAdminString, and can thus be trivially mapped to a
       securityName or groupName as defined in VACM, in
       accordance with a security policy.

       When used in conjunction with such a security policy all
       entries in the table belonging to a particular user (or
       group) will have the same value for this initial index.
       For a given user's entries in a particular table, the
       object identifiers for the information in these entries
       will have the same subidentifiers (except for the 'column'
       subidentifier) up to the end of the encoded owner index.
       To configure VACM to permit access to this portion of the
       table, one would create vacmViewTreeFamilyTable entries
       with the value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree including
       the owner index portion, and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask
       'wildcarding' the column subidentifier.  More elaborate
