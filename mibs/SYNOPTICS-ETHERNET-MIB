	ACCESS	read-write
	STATUS	mandatory
	DESCRIPTION
		"This s3EnetConcSecureStatus object indicates whether
		the security features (both allowed nodes and
		LattisSecure) for the concentrator are active or
		inactive.  If security is active, this object also
		indicates whether the allowed nodes feature is
		controlled at the concentrator, board, or port level.
		LattisSecure features are always controlled at the
		port level.  (See the Authorized Nodes tables for
		more information about how the allowed nodes and
		LattisSecure receive security features are
		configured.)

		If this object is set to concSecureOn(2), then the
		allowed nodes feature is controlled at the
		concentrator level and activated for every
		non-LattisSecure Ethernet port in the concentrator.
		If an authorized node violation occurs on any port,
		the action specified in s3EnetConcAuthAction is taken.

		If this object is set to portCheckOn(3), then allowed
		nodes is controlled at the port level by the
		s3EnetPortSecureStatus object for that port.  The
		port's s3EnetPortAuthAction determines the action
		taken when authorized nodes violations occur on that
		port.

		If this object is set to slotCheckOn(4), then allowed
		nodes is controlled at the board level by the
		s3EnetBoardSecureStatus object for that board.
		The board's s3EnetBoardAuthAction determines the
		action taken when authorized nodes violations
		occur on that board's ports.

		If this object is set to concentratorOff(5), then
		all security features, including LattisSecure, are
		deactivated for the entire concentrator.

		No matter what the status of this object, the board
		and port level SecureStatus and AuthAction are not
		lost even if they are not currently being used.  Thus,
		the user can change a port's status even if this object
		is slotCheckOn(4).  If this object is then changed to
		portCheckOn(3), then the change will take effect.

		The agent must support download of this object in the
		CFG file.

		In release 4.0, this object was called
		s3EnetConcAuthStatus."

		sendTrapPartition(5)-- do both sendTrap and partition
		}

	DESCRIPTION
		"If s3EnetConcSecureStatus is concSecureOn(2) and a

--    * initial download in a configuration file
--    * SNMP set request
--    * LattisSecure "one-shot" automatic address learning (addresses
--      learned while the port is in continuous auto learn mode will

		Allowed nodes for LattisSecure ports must be configured

		monitor the threshold.

		When the value of the object s3EnetThreshObject

		specific slot, which is identified by the value
		of the object s3EnetThreshSlot.  The slot must
		be on the same segment as the NMM in order for

		        2.) The object s3EnetThreshPort is not
		            used for creating slot level
		            thresholds, and is set to 0 by the
		            agent when the row is created.

		        3.) The objects s3EnetThreshPort and

		        4.) The value of s3EnetThreshDuration

		            status thresholds.

		To delete a row in the table, the object
		s3EnetThreshStatus needs to be specified in a
