      DESCRIPTION  "The MIB module which defines the textual conventions
                   used in IPSEC MIBs.  This includes Internet DOI
                   numbers defined in RFC 2407, ISAKMP numbers defined
                   in RFC 2408, and IKE numbers defined in RFC 2409.

                   These Textual Conventions are defined in a seperate
                   MIB module since they are protocol numbers managed
                   by the IANA.  Revision control after publication
                   will be under the authority of the IANA."
