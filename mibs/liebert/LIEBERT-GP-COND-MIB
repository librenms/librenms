        "A list of condition table entries.  The table contains zero, one,

         in effect.  The number of rows in the table is given by
         (lgpConditionsPresent).  The table is initially empty at agent startup.
         The agent creates a row in the table each time a condition is detected
         and deletes that row subject to the following rules:

         Rows are removed from the table based on the following rules:
         1. If a condition does not require acknowledgement
            (see 'lgpConditionAckReq') the condition is removed as soon as
            the issue clears (see 'lgpConditionCurrentState').
         2. If a condition requires acknowledgement (see 'lgpConditionAckReq')
            the condition is removed as soon as the issue clears
            (see 'lgpConditionCurrentState') AND the condition is acknowledged
            (see 'lgpConditionAcknowledged').
         3. If the columns 'lgpConditionCurrentState' and
            'lgpConditionAcknowledged' are not present for the condition
            then the condition will be removed as soon as the issue causing
            the condition clears.

         The agent creates the first row with lgpConditionId equal to 1,
         and increments the value of 'lgpConditionId' each time a new row is
         created, wrapping to the first free value greater than or equal to 1
         when the maximum value of lgpConditionId would otherwise be exceeded.
         The number of rows in the table at any given time is reflected by
         the value of 'lgpConditionsPresent'.
