        DESCRIPTION
            "This object will be included as a varbind in some
             lgpEventNotifications.  It is a reference to a table object in 
             the MIB.  The value of this object will be the OID of a table 
             that the object that the notification applies to is defined.
             The notification containing this object will also contain 
             a varbind 'lgpEventParmTableRowRef' that will specify which 
             instance (row) in the table the object is defined in.

             Example:
               NOTIFICATION: lgpEventConditionEntryAdded
               varbind: lgpConditionId          6
               varbind: lgpConditionDescr       lgpConditionRcpBranchBreakerOpen

               varbind: lgpEventParmTableRowRef lgpPduRbEntryId.1.4

             In the above example the breaker opened for a Receptacle branch.
             The specific receptacle branch is specified by the additional
             varbind (lgpEventParmTableRowRef).  In this case the notification
             is for the 4th receptacle branch on the 1st PDU in the PDU cluster.

        DESCRIPTION
            "This is a reference to the intersection of a row and column (cell)
             in the table specified by the companion varbind 
             (lgpEventParmTableRef) in this notification.  The row in the
             table where this cell exists represents the object that this
             notification applies to.

             Example:
               NOTIFICATION: lgpEventRcpPowerStateChangeOff
               varbind: sysUpTime               393885975

               varbind: lgpEventParmTableRowRef lgpPduRcpEntryId.2.4.5

             In the above example the power state changed for a Receptacle.

             The table containing the definition of the receptacle
             (lgpPduRcpTable) is given by the varbind (lgpEventParmTableRef)

             The specific receptacle is specified by the varbind
             (lgpEventParmTableRowRef).  In this case the notification
             is for the 5th receptacle on the 4th receptacle branch on the 
             2nd PDU in the PDU cluster.

             If one wanted to retrieve the user assigned label for this 
             receptacle the OID would be: lgpPduRcpEntryUsrLabel.2.4.5
