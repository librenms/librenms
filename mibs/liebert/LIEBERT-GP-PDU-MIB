DESCRIPTION
    "This value represents a bit-field of the various operational
     states of the PDUs that are part of the cluster of PDUs
     being monitored by this agent.

     This value is the bit-wise logical OR of all of the
     'lgpPduEntrySysStatus' columns in the 'lgpPduTable'
     which represents the combined statuses of all PDUs for this agent.

     Note the bit-position is given parenthetically next to the operational
     state in the description below.  The bit position is big-endian
     (least significant digit is the right-most digit).  The state is
     present in the PDU when the bit is on (value = 1).

     The value is a logical OR of all of the following potential states of
     each PDU in the cluster.

         normalOperation(1)
             One or more PDUs in the cluster are operating normally with no
             active warnings or alarms.
         startUp(2)
             One or more PDUs are in the startup state (initializing).  Control
             and monitoring operations may be inhibited or unavailable
             while the PDU is in this state.  This state will clear
             automatically when the PDU(s) are fully initialized and ready to
             accept control and monitoring commands.
         unknownNoSupport(4)
             The state of one or more PDUs are not known at this time or
             there is no support for this piece of information from 1 or more
             PDUs in the cluster/group.
         normalWithWarning(8)
             One or more PDUs are operating normally with one or more active
             warnings.  Appropriate personnel should investigate the
             warning(s) as soon as possible and take appropriate action.
         normalWithAlarm(16)
             One or more PDUs are operating normally with one or more active
             alarms.  Appropriate personnel should investigate the alarm(s)
             as soon as possible and take appropriate action.
         abnormalOperation(32)
            One ore more PDUs are operating abnormally.  There is a
            failure within the system that is unexpected under normal
            operating conditions.  Appropriate personnel should investigate
            the cause as soon as possible.  The normal functioning of
            the system is likely inhibited.
         unknownCommFailure(64)
            The state of one or more PDUs are not known due to a communications
            failure between the PDU hardware and the communications
            module.  This state is usually indicative of a hardware
            problem.

         This table contains 1 row, for potential sensor for each PDU.
         The rows in this table are created by the agent based on the maximum
         number of sensor's supported for each PDU.

         Each row in the table represents an auxiliary sensor, identified by its
         factory assigned serial number and its placement in the lgpPduAuxMeasTable.
         If all serial numbers in this table are empty strings then the
         location of the sensors in the lgpPduAuxMeasTable will default to the
         agent's default placement algorithm.  If sensors in the

         the location of the unrepresented sensor(s) in the lgpPduAuxMeasTable,
         and other display mediums, will be determined by the agent, but in no
         case will an unrepresented sensor occupy a position reserved for a sensor

         this table.

         Note that it is possible to have entries in this table representing sensors
         that may not exist on the given PDU at runtime. These allocated by not present
