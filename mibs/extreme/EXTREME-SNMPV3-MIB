		DESCRIPTION
		"When this object is set to TRUE, the version of the trap/notification sent to 
		the corresponding management target (trap receiver) will be the same as in 
		releases of Extremeware prior to 7.1.0. Thus, the value of the 
		snmpTargetParamsMPModel object in the snmpTargetParamsTable will be ignored while
		determining the version of the trap/notification to be sent. When a trap-receiver
		is created via the RMON trapDestTable or from the CLI command 'configure snmp add
		trapreceiver ....', the value of this object will be set to TRUE for the 
		corresponding entry in this table."

		SYNTAX TruthValue
		MAX-ACCESS read-write
		STATUS current
		DESCRIPTION
		"When this object is set to TRUE, the management target will be treated as 
		a 'standard mode' one, in that any Extreme Networks specific extra varbinds 
		present in a standards-based trap/notification will not be sent to this 
		management target. Only the varbinds defined in the standard will be sent."

                STATUS current
                DESCRIPTION
                "This object is used only when sending RMON alarms as SNMPv3 traps.
                When it is set to TRUE and an RMON risingAlarm or fallingAlarm is being sent
                for an event, then the eventCommunity in the RMON event table is compared to 
                the snmpTargetAddrName in the snmpTargetAddrTable. The alarm is sent to the 
                target only when the two are the same. This behavior is exhibited only when the
                snmpTargetParamsMPModel corresponding to the target indicates an SNMPv3 trap. For 
                SNMPv1/v2c traps, the community in the RMON trapDestTable is used for the 
                comparision, which is the 'regular' method, as per the standards.
                When this object is set to FALSE, then the RMON alarm (if being sent as an SNMPv3
                trap) is sent without using the event community for any comparision."
