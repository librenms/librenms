                   This object allows a set of objects to be locked.
                   The lock is only assured by the 'cooperation' of 
                   other management entities; they must wait until 
                   the lock is cleared (to value zero) prior to 
                   setting the lock. When this object is set to a 
                   management entity's IP address, if no other 
                   management entity has previously set the lock, the
                   set will succeed.  Otherwise, an error (BadValue) 
                   will be returned. It is the responsibility of the
                   owning management entity to clear the lock when 
                   the transactions complete. To protect against a 
                   management entity failure during a locked 
                   transaction, the agent is NOT responsible for 
                   verifying which management entity is performing 
                   transactions on locked objects; thus, any 
                   management entity can clear this object at any 
                   time. The agent does not do anything with this 
                   object except disallow multiple sets of different
                   IP addresses (unless the object has been cleared 
                   to zero). This means management entities can use 
                   this for locking any valid transactions on defined
                   sets of objects.  This object can also be used on
                   IPX networks by specifying the low 4 bytes of the

                   The hubAddressChunk object returns an opaque
                   chunk of the address table. Each chunk can be
                   interpreted as an array of records in the form:

                       mac address [6 bytes], port number [2 bytes],
                       inactivity time [4 bytes]

                   On a Get, the returned chunk can include empty
                   (unused) entries.  Instances are chunk numbers,
                   which start at 1 and go to 52.  Each chunk can
                   hold 34 addresses.

                   A returned chunk might look like:

                       Address       Port      Inactivity Time

                       080009001234  1         0

                       080009003456  1         20000
                       000000000000  1         0
                       080009009876  EMPTY     0
                       080009004567  EMPTY     15000
                                     .
                                     .
                                     .
                       080009005678  EOL       959000

                   A value of EMPTY in the Port field indicates an
                   unused (i.e.  aged out) entry in the table.  When
                   the EOL (End Of List) bit is set in the Port 
                   field, that entry is the last entry in the table.
                   It is possible for EOL to be seen in any entry.
                   EOL (0x4000) and EMPTY (0x8000) are bit masks
                   which are ORed with the port number in the port
                   field of the entry.  It is possible for both the
                   EOL and EMPTY bits to be set in the same entry.

                   The remainder of the chunk after the EOL entry
                   will be zeroed.

                   The inactivityTime and Address fields are
                   meaningless if the EMPTY bit is set in the Port
                   field. In this case, inactivityTime and Address
                   are not guaranteed to be zeroed.  The Manager may
                   start with any chunk it likes and request the
                   chunks in any order.  It may perform multiple
                   requests for the same chunk.  The agent does not
                   save state from previous requests.

                   A request of chunk #1 would return the contents of
                   the first 34 address table entries,  whether they
                   are all full, all empty, or some full and the rest
                   empty.  A request of chunk #2 will return entries
                   #35 through #68. And so on.

                   The address table can change between Get requests.
                   An address' location can change, or an address
                   could age out and then be added back in at a
                   different location in the table.  Thus, the
                   Manager could see the address twice in the table."

                   send a test packet to the device at the end of the
                   link.  If there are no responses (the number is
                   configurable), the hub will enable the backup port
                   and disable the primary port.  After the primary

                   determine if it is currently in use.

                   The backup link algorithm enables and disables the
                   backup port by modifying rptrPortAdminStatus for
                   that port.  After the backup port has been enabled
                   by the backup link algorithm, if the primary port
                   is subsequently enabled via the hub console port
                   or by a set of rptrPortAdminStatus, the backup
                   port will be turned off and the periodic test
                   packets will begin again.

                   When the backup link objects are set, the backup
                   port will be turned off, the primary port will be
                   turned on,  and the periodic test packets will be
                   sent.  The time between test packets is
                   configurable by setting hubBackupTestTime.  The
                   number of failures needed to switch to the backup
                   link is configured by setting
                   hubBackupConsecutiveFails.  The backup link
                   function can be turned off by setting
                   hubBackupPort to 0.

                   All five of the backup link objects must be set
                   together in a single PDU except for the case of
                   setting hubBackupPort to 0, in which case, the
                   hubBackupPort can be set without setting the other
                   objects.  Currently, the size of the backup link
                   table is one; future releases may provide the
                   ability to monitor more than one backup link."

                   aged out table entry.  A value of EOL in the Port
                   field indicates that it is the last entry in the
                   table.  Of course, EOL will only be seen in the
                   last entry.  EOL and EMPTY are AND-able bit

                   When instance=1 is used on a Set, the agent clears
                   the table prior to setting any addresses.  On
                   subsequent Sets, the agent adds the specified
                   addresses.  If a Set starts at instance > 1, the
                   specified addresses will be added to the table
                   without first clearing the table.  Addresses are
                   already in the table are deleted and then

                   "********* THIS OBJECT IS OBSOLETE *********

                   This object contains the binary value used to
                   filter frames. The data in the frame at the offset
                   specified by the Wildcard offsets is XOR'ed with
                   this object after AND'ing with the Wildcard Mask.
                   If zero result occurs, the packet is discarded
                   (filtered).

                   Suppose the user specifies the following values:
                       data:   11001010 10101010 10101010 10101010
                       mask:   11100000 00000000 00000000 00000000
                       filter: 11100000 00000000 00000000 00000000

                       AND'ing data with the mask gives:
                               11000000 00000000 00000000 00000000

                       XOR'ing that value with the filter gives:
                               00100000 00000000 00000000 00000000

                       The non-zero result indicates no match (don't
                       discard).

                   Another example:
                       data:   10011010 10101010 10101010 10101010
                       mask:   10010000 00000000 00000000 00000000
                       filter: 10010000 00000000 00000000 00000000

                       AND'ing data with the mask gives:
                               10010000 00000000 00000000 00000000

                       XOR'ing that value with the filter gives:
                               00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000

                       A zero result indicates a match, so we discard
                       (filter) the packet.

                   The filter AND'ed with the mask must equal the
                   filter. This is an example of a legal filter/mask
                   pair:
                       filter: 00010000 00000000 00000000 00000000
                       mask:   10010000 00000000 00000000 00000000
                       AND'ed: 00010000 00000000 00000000 00000000
                               (equals filter)

                   Another way of saying this: if a mask bit is zero,
                   the corresponding filter bit must be zero.

                   The following would be an illegal pair:
                       filter: 01110000 00000000 00000000 00000000
                       mask:   10010000 00000000 00000000 00000000
                       AND'ed: 00010000 00000000 00000000 00000000

                   This value is a byte offset from the beginning

                   packet (for wildcard filtering purposes, the FCS
                   is part of the packet), then the filter is
                   considered not to match, and the packet is not
                   filtered.

                   For a particular filter, the wildcardUserOffset
                   must be greater than or equal to the
                   wildcardOffset.

                   wildcardUserOffset must be between 0 and 1514,
                   inclusive.

                   The wildcardUserOffset, wildcardOffset pair must
                   conform to one of the following four relationships
                   and also be subject to the range restrictions

                   Example A corresponds to a UserOffset/Offset pair
