                   "********* THIS OBJECT IS DEPRECATED *********

                   The local name of this repeater.  This is the 
                   same value as hpicfEntityName in the case where 
                   there is Distributed Management Protocol to access
                   this device.

                   For SNMPv1, this name is appended to the agent 
                   community name to obtain a community name to use
                   to specify that the agent should proxy to this
                   repeater.  For example, if this agent has a 
                   community with a community name of 'public', and
                   the value of this object is 'repeater1', the 
                   community 'public/repeater1' will specify that the
                   agent should proxy to the public community of the
                   repeater1 box to obtain management information
                   about this repeater.

                   If an agent receives a management request where 
                   the localEntity is not specified, it will default 
                   to the local repeater on which this agent is 
                   executing.

                   This object has been deprecated.  Since it is a
                   scalar, it does not scale to systems containing
                   multiple repeater segments.  In addition, it is only
                   considered useful in systems supporting the
                   Distributed Management Chain, which has also been
                   deprecated."
