                    This table is used to map an interface index to a

                    by autodiscovery to figure out which entLogicalIndex
                    corresponds to a particular network address.  This
                    table is not intended as a general purpose mapping.
                    In particular, in some systems the same interface
                    can be in use by multiple logical entities.  Also,
                    there is no requirement that ifIndex is unique
                    across all logical entities (such as the case where
                    multiple agents in the same chassis each assign
                    ifIndex without knowledge of how the other agents
                    are assigning ifIndex).  Therefore, these mappings
                    are only defined to hold for the special purpose
                    of getting from the discovered transport address for
                    a logical device to the entLogicalIndex needed for
                    announce address and search address.  Also, note
                    that this table will not contain entries for all
                    of the values of ifIndex.  It will only contain
                    entries for interfaces that can be used for sending

                    'system event' traps that will be sent to a specific
                    receiver.

                    This filter is specified as a sum of values, where
                    each value specifies a classification of traps that
                    will be sent to this trap receiver.  The value for a
                    particular trap class C is computed as 2 raised to
                    a value representing C.  The trap classes are
                    defined as follows:

                    C (bit#)   Trap class
                    -----------------------------------------------
                    0          SNMP traps
                    1          informational events
                    2          warning events
                    3          critical events
                    4          debug events (HP internal use only)

                    For example, to specify that this trap receiver
                    should recieve SNMP traps and critical event traps,
                    this object should be set to a value of 9 (2^0 +
                    2^3).

                    Note that some agents may not support
                    trap filtering.  Those agents may either implement
                    this object as read-only, or with a restricted
                    write syntax."
