                   "This flag controls whether or not the device will
                   send self healing packets.  Self healing packets are
                   normally sent once per second by the agent when no
                   other traffic is present.  When there is no traffic
                   present on a network, there is no way to detect
                   cabling problems (or the repair of cabling problems)
                   and status LEDs are not always correct.

                   Enabling this flag allows the agent to detect cabling
                   problems on an idle network.  This flag can be
                   disabled if self healing packets are not wanted.

                   On the 100BaseVG-AnyLAN SNMP/Bridge card, these
                   packets are addressed to a unique unused unicast
                   station address which has been reserved by HP for
                   this purpose.  On 802.3 repeaters, these packets are
                   self addressed.

                   On an 802.3 repeater, this flag MUST be enabled when
                   using the Robust Port Healing feature.  Without
                   Robust Port Healing either a good transmit or a good
                   receive will reconnect an autopartitioned port.  With
                   Robust Port Healing the criteria is more restrictive
                   and only a good transmit will heal a segmented port.
                   If all ports are segmented, the repeater will not
                   repeat anything until the agent transmits a self
                   healing packet and reconnects the autopartitioned
                   ports."

                   hpicfBackupLinkIndex.  The value 0 indicates that no
                   unassigned values are available.

                   In order to cause a non-zero value of this object to
                   be assigned for use as the hpicfBackupLinkIndex of a
                   future backup link configuration, it must be
                   successfully modified by a set operation.  When
                   modified by a set operation, the new value must
                   precisely match the value presently held by the
                   object.  If not, the management protocol set
                   operation will fail.

                   Immediately after the completion of a successful set
                   operation, the agent must modify the value of this
                   object.  The algorithm for modifying the value is
                   implementation-dependent, and may use a subset of
                   values within the legal range.  However, the agent
                   must guarantee that the new value is not assigned to
                   any in-use value of hpicfBackupLinkIndex.

                   A management station creates a new backup link using
                   this algorithm:

                      - issue a management protocol retrieval operation
                        to obtain the value of hpicfBackupLinkNextIndex;
                        if the retrieved value is zero, a new backup
                        link cannot be created at this time;

                      - issue a management protocol set operation for
                        hpicfBackupLinkNextIndex, supplying the same
                        value as obtained in the previous step;

                      - if the set operation succeeds, use the supplied
                        value as the hpicfBackupLinkIndex of the new
                        backup link; if the set operation fails, go back
                        to the first step and obtain a new value for
                        hpicfBackupLinkNextIndex;

                      - issue a management protocol set operation to
                        create an instance of the hpicfBackupLinkStatus
                        object setting its value to 'createAndGo' or
                        'createAndWait' (as specified in the description
                        of the RowStatus textual convention).

                    Note that the set of hpicfBackupLinkNextIndex and
                    the instance of hpicfBackupLinkStatus may occur in

                   "A table of backup link configuration entries.  For
                   a given backup link, the agent will periodically send
                   a test packet to the device at the specified address.
                   If no response is received after a configured number
                   of test packets are sent, the agent will enable the
                   backup port and disable the primary port, and will
                   stop sending periodic test packets.  After the agent
                   has switched to the backup link, the primary port
                   will need to explicitly be re-enabled via management
                   action in order to return to using the primary port.

                   At any time, a management station can examine the
                   associated instance of the hpicfBackupLinkState
                   object to determine if the backup port is currently
                   in use.

                   The backup link algorithm enables and disables the
                   backup port by modifying the instance of the
                   rptrPortAdminStatus object corresponding to that
                   port.  After the backup port has been enabled by the
                   backup link algorithm, if the primary port is
                   subsequently enabled via management action, the
                   backup port will be turned off and the periodic
                   test packets will resume.

                   When a row of this table is activated, the backup
                   port will be disabled, the primary port will be
                   enabled, and the periodic test packets will be sent.
                   The time between test packets is configurable using
                   the associated instance of the
                   hpicfBackupLinkTestTime object.  The number of
                   failures needed to switch to the backup port is
                   configurable using the associated instance of the
                   hpicfBackupLinkConsecFailures object.  The backup
                   link function can be disabled by setting the relevant
                   instance of the hpicfBackupLinkStatus object to
                   either 'notInService' or 'destroy'.

                   Note that the primary port for a backup link must
                   be mapped to a repeater segment that the agent is
                   capable of transmitting through.  In addition, a
                   given port cannot be used in more than one active
                   backup link at the same time."
