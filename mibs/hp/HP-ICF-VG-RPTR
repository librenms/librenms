                   For SNMPv1, this name is appended to the agent 
                   community name to obtain a community name to use
                   to specify that the agent should proxy to this
                   repeater.  For example, if this agent has a 
                   community with a community name of 'public', and
                   the value of this object is 'repeater1', the

                   to disallow such training.  However, some end-nodes

                   training occurring on the repeater because of this.
                   In addition, some end-node applications may not work
                   when initial training fails due to the locking out of
                   null MAC addresses.

                   The default setting of this object is to allow null
                   MAC addresses to train.  This is recommended for most
                   situations, despite the fact that it contradicts the
                   802.12 standard.

                   security on this hub, disallowing null-address
                   training provides the most extensive security until
                   the ports' authorized addresses are learned.
                   However, if this creates problems for the end-node
                   applications, it may be necessary to instead
                   explicitly assign the ports' authorized addresses
                   and configure this object to allow null-address
