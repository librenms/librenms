    DESCRIPTION
           "A user intereseted to obtain extended debug capabilities should
            SET this MIB to a well known secret value (it is intended to be
            used only by authorized users).
            Most often, this value will be based on the device MAC address.
            Upon setting the correct value, the SET operation will return
            noError. Otherwise, wrongValue will return to the caller.
            GET operation on this MIB will reurn a value of length 0."
