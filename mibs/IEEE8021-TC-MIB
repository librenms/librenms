        group-isid(6)     24 Bit identifier as described below.
        ieeeReserved(7)  Reserved for definition by IEEE Std 802.1

        To support future extensions, the IEEE8021ServiceSelectorType
        textual convention SHOULD NOT be subtyped in object type
        definitions.  It MAY be subtyped in compliance statements in
        order to require only a subset of these address types for a
        compliant implementation.

        The tesid is used as a service selector for MAs that are present
        in Bridges that implement PBB-TE functionality.  A selector of
        this type is interpreted as a 32 bit unsigned value of type
        IEEE8021PbbTeTSidId.  This type is used to index the
        ieee8021PbbTeTeSiEspTable to find the ESPs which comprise the TE
        Service Instance named by this TE-SID value.
        
        The segid is used as a service selector for MAs that are present
        in Bridges that implement IPS functionality.  A selector of
        this type is interpreted as a 32 bit unsigned value of type
        IEEE8021TeipsSegid.  This type is used to index the
        Ieee8021TeipsSegTable to find the SMPs which comprise the
        Infrastructure Segment named by this segid value.

        The path-tesid is used as a service selector for SPBM path MAs.
        A selector of this type is interpreted as a 32 bit unsigned value
        corresponding to the MA index dot1agCfmMaIndex. This type is used
        to index the dot1agCfmMepSpbmEspTable to find the ESPs which
        comprise the SPBM path associated with an SPBM path MA.

        The group-isid is used as a service selector for SPBM group MAs.
        A selector of this type is interpreted as a 24 bit unsigned value
        corresponding to the I-SID associated with an SPBM group MA.

        Implementations MUST ensure that IEEE8021ServiceSelectorType
        objects and any dependent objects (e.g.,
        IEEE8021ServiceSelectorValue objects) are consistent.  An
        inconsistentValue error MUST be generated if an attempt to
        change an IEEE8021ServiceSelectorType object would, for
        example, lead to an undefined IEEE8021ServiceSelectorValue value."

IEEE8021ServiceSelectorValueOrNone ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

    STATUS       current

        "An integer that uniquely identifies a generic MAC Service,
         or none.  Examples of service selectors are a VLAN-ID
         (IEEE 802.1Q) and an I-SID (IEEE Std 802.1ah).

         An IEEE8021ServiceSelectorValueOrNone value is always
         interpreted within the context of an
         IEEE8021ServiceSelectorType value.  Every usage of the
         IEEE8021ServiceSelectorValueOrNone textual convention is
         required to specify the IEEE8021ServiceSelectorType object
         that provides the context.  It is suggested that the
         IEEE8021ServiceSelectorType object be logically registered
         before the object(s) that use the
         IEEE8021ServiceSelectorValueOrNone textual convention, if
         they appear in the same logical row.

         The value of an IEEE8021ServiceSelectorValueOrNone object
         must always be consistent with the value of the associated
         IEEE8021ServiceSelectorType object.  Attempts to set an
         IEEE8021ServiceSelectorValueOrNone object to a value
         inconsistent with the associated
         IEEE8021ServiceSelectorType must fail with an
         inconsistentValue error.

         The special value of zero is used to indicate that no
         service selector is present or used.  This can be used in
         any situation where an object or a table entry MUST either
         refer to a specific service, or not make a selection.

         Note that a MIB object that is defined using this
         TEXTUAL-CONVENTION SHOULD clarify the meaning of
         'no service' (i.e., the special value 0), as well as the
         maximum value (i.e., 4094, for a VLAN ID)."

    DESCRIPTION
        "An integer that uniquely identifies a generic MAC Service.
         Examples of service selectors are a VLAN-ID (IEEE 802.1Q)
         and an I-SID (IEEE Std 802.1ah).

         An IEEE8021ServiceSelectorValue value is always interpreted
         within the context of an IEEE8021ServiceSelectorType value.
         Every usage of the IEEE8021ServiceSelectorValue textual
         convention is required to specify the
         IEEE8021ServiceSelectorType object that provides the context.
         It is suggested that the IEEE8021ServiceSelectorType object
         be logically registered before the object(s) that use the
         IEEE8021ServiceSelectorValue textual convention, if they
         appear in the same logical row.

         The value of an IEEE8021ServiceSelectorValue object must
         always be consistent with the value of the associated
         IEEE8021ServiceSelectorType object.  Attempts to set an
         IEEE8021ServiceSelectorValue object to a value inconsistent
         with the associated IEEE8021ServiceSelectorType must fail
         with an inconsistentValue error.

         Note that a MIB object that is defined using this
         TEXTUAL-CONVENTION SHOULD clarify the
         maximum value (i.e., 4094, for a VLAN ID)."
