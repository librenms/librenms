         STATUS current
         DESCRIPTION
                "bdcomPibToMib is the root of the BDCOM-assigned
                OID subtree for MIBs which are algorithmically
                generated/translated from BDCOM PIBs with OIDs
                assigned under the bdcomPIB subtree.
                These generated MIBs allow management
                entities (other the current Policy Server) to
                read the downloaded policy.  By convention, for PIB
                'bdcomPIB.x', the generated MIB shall have the
                name 'bdcomPibToMib.x'."
