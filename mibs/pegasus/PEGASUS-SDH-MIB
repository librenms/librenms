  DESCRIPTION
    "This MIB applies to the PEGASUS SDSL product manufactured by Schmid
    Telecom Zurich. The MIB is modelled after the PEM management model, so
    object hierarchy and individual variables agree with the PEM client. This 
    MIB represents an extension to the DS1-MIB and the SONET-MIB. These three
    MIB files are used to manage the PEGASUS STM-1 card.

    The PEGASUS-SDH-MIB contains five tables:
    - stm1CardTable         one entry for each STM-1 card configured.
    - stm1CardClockTable    one entry for each STM-1 card configured.
    - ethernetIfTable       one entry for each Ethernet interface of a 
                              configured STM-1 card.
    - vcTable               one entry for each Virtual Container (VC-3/4/12).
    - tugConfigTable        one entry for each Tributary Unit Group (TUG-3).

    Note
    - The tables that represent extensions to the DS1-/SINET-MIB use the 
      ifIndex from IF-MIB (ifTable)."

  DESCRIPTION
    "Improved Alarm signalisation. A new variable stm1CardAlarmStatus shows 
    the alarms that are active on the STM-1 card. Active Ethernet alarms are 
    shown by ethernetIfAlarmStatus. The following values for vcAlarmStatus 
    are can not occur (not used):
        - vcgTxAddTimeout     - vcgDnuOk
        - vcgTxAdd            - vcgRxAdd
        - vcgTxRemove         - vcgRxRemove

  DESCRIPTION
    "Actually, only GFP is supported as Ethernet Encapsulation. Therefore 
    the variable etherIfEncapsulation is now read-only."
