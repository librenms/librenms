       DESCRIPTION
           "An octet string containing a tag value.
            Tag values are preferably in human-readable form.

            To facilitate internationalization, this information
            is represented using the ISO/IEC IS 10646-1 character
            set, encoded as an octet string using the UTF-8
            character encoding scheme described in RFC 2279.

            Since additional code points are added by amendments
            to the 10646 standard from time to time,
            implementations must be prepared to encounter any code
            point from 0x00000000 to 0x7fffffff.

            The use of control codes should be avoided, and certain
            control codes are not allowed as described below.

            For code points not directly supported by user
            interface hardware or software, an alternative means
            of entry and display, such as hexadecimal, may be
            provided.

            For information encoded in 7-bit US-ASCII, the UTF-8
            representation is identical to the US-ASCII encoding.

            Note that when this TC is used for an object that
            is used or envisioned to be used as an index, then a
            SIZE restriction must be specified so that the number
            of sub-identifiers for any object instance does not
            exceed the limit of 128, as defined by [RFC1905].

            An object of this type contains a single tag value
            which is used to select a set of entries in a table.

            A tag value is an arbitrary string of octets, but
            may not contain a delimiter character.  Delimiter
            characters are defined to be one of the following:

                -  An ASCII space character (0x20).

                -  An ASCII TAB character (0x09).

                -  An ASCII carriage return (CR) character (0x0D).

                -  An ASCII line feed (LF) character (0x0B).

            Delimiter characters are used to separate tag values
            in a tag list.  An object of this type may only
            contain a single tag value, and so delimiter
            characters are not allowed in a value of this type.

            Some examples of valid tag values are:

                - 'acme'

                - 'router'

                - 'host'

            The use of a tag value to select table entries is
            application and MIB specific."

           "An octet string containing a list of tag values.

            The use of control codes should be avoided, except as
            described below.

            For code points not directly supported by user

            of entry and display, such as hexadecimal, may be

            For information encoded in 7-bit US-ASCII, the UTF-8
            representation is identical to the US-ASCII encoding.

            An object of this type contains a list of tag values
            which are used to select a set of entries in a table.

            A tag value is an arbitrary string of octets, but
            may not contain a delimiter character.  Delimiter
            characters are defined to be one of the following:

                -  An ASCII space character (0x20).

                -  An ASCII TAB character (0x09).

                -  An ASCII carriage return (CR) character (0x0D).

                -  An ASCII line feed (LF) character (0x0B).

            Delimiter characters are used to separate tag values
            in a tag list.  Only a single delimiter character may
            occur between two tag values.  A tag value may not
            have a zero length.  These constraints imply certain
            restrictions on the contents of this object:

                - There cannot be a leading or trailing delimiter
                  character.

                - There cannot be multiple adjacent delimiter
                  characters.

            Some examples of valid tag lists are:

                - An empty string

                - 'acme router'

                - 'host managerStation'

            Note that although a tag value may not have a length of
            zero, an empty string is still valid.  This indicates
            an empty list (i.e. there are no tag values in the list).

            The use of the tag list to select table entries is
            application and MIB specific.  Typically, an application
            will provide one or more tag values, and any entry
            which contains some combination of these tag values
            will be selected."

            The procedure for modifying the snmpTargetAddrTagList

                    retrieved value, and the value of

            may assume that the response will not be delivered.

            of timeouts which have occurred.  The type of message may
            also be considered when deriving expected round trip
            times for retransmissions.  For example, if a message is
            being sent with a securityLevel that indicates both
            authentication and privacy, the derived value may be
            increased to compensate for extra processing time spent

           "The bit mask which, in combination with the corresponding
            instance of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree, defines a family of
            subtrees which are included in or excluded from the
            filter profile.

            Each bit of this bit mask corresponds to a
            sub-identifier of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree, with the
            most significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet
            string value (extended if necessary, see below)
            corresponding to the (8*i - 7)-th sub-identifier, and
            the least significant bit of the i-th octet of this
            octet string corresponding to the (8*i)-th
            sub-identifier, where i is in the range 1 through 16.

            Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not
            the corresponding sub-identifiers must match when
            determining if an OBJECT IDENTIFIER matches this
            family of filter subtrees; a '1' indicates that an
            exact match must occur; a '0' indicates 'wild card',
            i.e., any sub-identifier value matches.

            Thus, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER X of an object instance
            is contained in a family of filter subtrees if, for
            each sub-identifier of the value of
            snmpNotifyFilterSubtree, either:

              the i-th bit of snmpNotifyFilterMask is 0, or

              the i-th sub-identifier of X is equal to the i-th
              sub-identifier of the value of
              snmpNotifyFilterSubtree.

            If the value of this bit mask is M bits long and
            there are more than M sub-identifiers in the
            corresponding instance of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree,
            then the bit mask is extended with 1's to be the
            required length.

            Note that when the value of this object is the
            zero-length string, this extension rule results in
            a mask of all-1's being used (i.e., no 'wild card'),
            and the family of filter subtrees is the one
