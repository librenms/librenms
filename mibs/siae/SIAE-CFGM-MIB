--
--  This group is used to manage the Configuration present in the equipment
--
--  Uploading operations:
--    - Creation of the configuration file
--    - FTP tranfer of the configuration file toward the manager
--
--  Downloading operations:
--    - FTP tranfer of the configuration file toward the equipment
--    - Check if the configuration file is suitable for the equipment
--    - Save the current configuration to eventually return to it
--    - Overwrite current configuration with the downloaded one
--    - Restart the equipment
--
--  Return to previous configuration:
--    - Check if the previously saved configuration file exists
--    - Overwrite current configuration with the previously saved one
--    - Restart the equipment or execute a bench switch
