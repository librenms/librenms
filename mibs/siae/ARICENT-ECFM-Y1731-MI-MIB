       "The Maintenance Entity Group End Point (MEP) table.

        Each row in the table represents a different MEP. A MEP is
        an actively managed CFM entity, associated with a specific
        DSAP of a Service Instance, which can generate and receive
        CFM PDUs and track any responses.  It is an end point of a
        single Maintenance Entity.

        This table uses three indices. The first two indices are the
        indices of the Maintenance Entity Group (MEG) and Maintenance 
        Entity (ME) tables, the reason being that a MEP is always 
        related to an ME and MEG.

        The MEP table stores all the managed objects for sending
        LBM, LTM, AIS and LCK. This table also stores all the managed
        objects required for monitoring the performance.

        The objects which are used to initiate a transaction are to
        be set only when the row-status of the table is active.
        'fsMIY1731MepTransmit' naming convention is used to isolate 
        these objects from the others.
