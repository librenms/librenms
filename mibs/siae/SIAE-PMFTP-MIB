--  pmFTP (File PM Data Read) Group
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
--  This group is used to read P.M. data through a file transfer (FTP)
--  It is common to all Performance Monitoring group and RMON.
--  For each Performance Monitoring group (and RMON) and for each Termination
--  point (TP class) two file are generated: one concerning the day before and
--  one concerning the current day.
--
--  Through the objects of this group it is possible to read each file.
--  After transfering, local files are deleted.
--
--  To avoid concurrency, values set are internally collected per user and IP
--  address. So, to ensure a successful transfer, manager needs to set 
--  pmFTPfileName, pmFTPObject and pmFTPActionRequest (optionally also
--  pmFTPBeginInterval, pmFTPEndInterval and pmFTPTpRmonOwner). These object
--  can be  set sending more SNMP SET packets.
