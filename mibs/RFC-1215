RFC-1215 DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN

-- This  module is a empty module.  It has been created solely for the 
-- purpose of allowing other modules to correctly import the TRAP-TYPE 
-- clause from RFC-1215 where it should be imported from.  It's a
-- built in type in the UCD-SNMP code, and in fact RFC-1215 doesn't
-- actually define a mib at all; it only defines macros.  However,
-- importing the TRAP-TYPE is conventionally done from an import
-- clause pointing to RFC-1215.
