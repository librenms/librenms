    DESCRIPTION
      "The current operational state of the interface.
      The noIfIdentifier(3) state indicates that no valid
      Interface Identifier is assigned to the interface.
      This state usually indicates that the link-local

      If ipv6IfAdminStatus is down(2) then ipv6IfOperStatus
      should be down(2).  If ipv6IfAdminStatus is changed
      to up(1) then ipv6IfOperStatus should change to up(1)
      if the interface is ready to transmit and receive
      network traffic; it should remain in the down(2) or
      noIfIdentifier(3) state if and only if there is a
      fault that prevents it from going to the up(1) state;
      it should remain in the notPresent(5) state if
