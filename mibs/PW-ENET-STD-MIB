    DESCRIPTION
        "This table is indexed by the same index that was created
        for the associated entry in the PW generic table in the
        PW-STD-MIB module.
        The pwIndex and the pwEnetPwInstance are used as indexes
        to allow multiple VLANs to exist on the same PW.

        An entry is created in this table by the agent for every
        entry in the pwTable with a pwType of 'ethernetTagged'
        or 'ethernet'. Additional rows may be created by the
        operator or the agent if multiple entries are required for
        the same PW.

        The value of pwEnetPwInstance can be arbitrary selected
        to make the row unique, however implementations that know
        the VLAN field value when the row is created MAY use the
        value of the VLAN itself for better readability and
        backward compatibility with older versions of this MIB
        module.

        This table provides Ethernet port mapping and VLAN
        configuration for each Ethernet PW.

        All read-create object in this table MAY be changed at any
        time, however change of some objects (for example
        pwEnetVlanMode) during PW forwarding state MAY cause traffic
        disruption.

        Manual entries in this table SHOULD be preserved after a
        re-boot, the agent MUST ensure the integrity of those
        entries. If the set of entires of a specific row are found to
        be non consistent after reboot, the PW pwOperStatus MUST be
        declared as notPresent(5).

    DESCRIPTION
        "This object indicates the mode of VLAN handling between the
         port or the virtual port associated with the PW and the
         PW encapsulation.

        - 'other' indicates an operation that is not defined by
          this MIB module.

        - 'portBased' indicates that the forwarder will forward
          packets between the port and the PW independent of their
          structure (i.e. there is no service delimiting VLAN tags
          from the PE standpoint).

        - 'noChange' indicates that the PW contains the original
           user VLAN, as specified in pwEnetPortVlan, i.e. the
           VLAN on the PE-CE link is the service delimiting tag
           and is kept 'as is' on the PW.

        - 'changeVlan' indicates that the VLAN field on the PW
          may be different than the VLAN field on the user's
          port. The VLAN on the PE-CE link is the service delimiting
          tag but has a different value on the PW.

        - 'removeVlan' indicates that the encapsulation on the
          PW does not include the service delimiting VLAN field.
          Note that PRI bits transparency is lost in this case.

        - 'addVlan' indicates that a VLAN field will be added
          on the PSN bound direction (i.e. on the PW). pwEnetPwVlan
          indicates the value that will be added.

        - Implementation of 'portsbased', 'removeVlan', 'addVlan'
          'other' and 'changeVlan' is OPTIONAL.

    DESCRIPTION
        "This object defines if the mapping between the original port
        (physical port or VPLS virtual port) to the PW is VLAN based
        or not. In case of VLAN mapping, this object indicates the
        the VLAN value on the original port.

        The value of '4097' MUST be used if the whole original port
        traffic is mapped to the same PW. Note that a pwType of
        'ethernetTagged' can still be used if service delimiting tag
        is added on the PW (pwEnetVlanMode equals 'addVlan').

        This object MUST be equal to pwEnetPwVlan if pwEnetVlanMode
        equals 'noChange'.

        The value 4096 indicates packets without VLAN field
        (i.e. untagged frames) on the port are associated to this
        PW. This allows the same behavior as assigning 'Default
