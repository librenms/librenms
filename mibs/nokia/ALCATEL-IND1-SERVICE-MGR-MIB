        DESCRIPTION
        "The type of encapsulation protocol configured on this
         port's network interface.  If alaServiceMgrPortEncapType has a value
         of 'nullEncap', frames received will not carry any tags
         or labels and as a result only one service can be
         configured on this port.  Sometimes this is referred to
         as raw Ethernet packets. 
                 
         If alaServiceMgrPortEncapType has a value of 'qEncap', ingress frames 
         carry 802.1q tags where each different tag can signify a 
         different service. This is not a valid value if
         Port Class has a value of 'sonetPath'. 
                 
         If alaServiceMgrPortEncapType has a value of 'bcpNullEncap',
         Bcp is used on the sonet path as the NCP control protocol.
         The BCP IEEE 802 Tagged Frame Configuration Option (type 8)
         is negotiated to 'enabled'.  VLAN tagged frames are
         allowed into the sonet path.  Only a single SAP can
         be associated with the sonet path.  'bcpNullEncap' is 
         valid only if Port Class has a value of 'sonetPath'.
                 
         If alaServiceMgrPortEncapType has a value of 'bcpDot1qEncap',
         BCP is used as the NCP control protocol.  The BCP IEEE 802
         Tagged Frame Configuration Option (type 8) is negotiated to
         'enabled'.  VLAN tagged frames are allowed on the sonet path.
         This encapsulation type is required when multiple SAPs are
         defined on the sonet path where each one is service
         delimited by a provisioned Dot1q tag.  When 'bcpDot1qEncap'
         is specified, BCP does not enter the 'open' state unless
         the far end peer also supports 'bcpDot1qEncap'.  This allows
         a LCP negotiation to transmit configuration request and
         confirmation messages to enable this feature.  'bcpDot1qEncap'
         is a valid value only if Port Classhas a value of 'sonetPath'.
 
         If alaServiceMgrPortEncapType has a value of 'ipcpEncap',
         BCP will not be used on this sonet path.  IPCP NCP is used
         instead.  'ipcpEncap' is a valid only if Port Class has
         a value of 'sonetPath'.
         
         If alaServiceMgrPortEncapType has a value of 'frEncap', Frame Relay is
         the expected encapsulation.

         If alaServiceMgrPortEncapType has a value of 'pppAutoEncap', IPCP is 
         automatically enabled. This encap type is only valid on 
         ports/paths in network mode.

         If alaServiceMgrPortEncapType has a value of 'atmEncap', the encapsulation
         on the port is ATM. The 'atmEncap' is also used when mirroring
         ATM ports.

         If alaServiceMgrPortEncapType has a value of 'wanMirrorEncap', the 
         port is used for mirroring of frame-relay and POS ports. On such 
         ports no link management protocol would run.

         If alaServiceMgrPortEncapType has a value of 'ciscoHDLCEncap', the Cisco HDLC
         encapsulation is applied. This encap type is only valid if 
         Port Class has a value of 'tdm' or 'sonet'.
         
         If alaServiceMgrPortEncapType has a value of 'cemEncap', encapsulation of
         frames will be circuit emulation.  This is used to support transparent
         transmission of frames.  This encap type is only valid
         if Port Class has a value of 'tdm' or 'sonet' in access mode.

         alaServiceMgrPortEncapType is set to 'unknown' for physical SONET/SDH and
         TDM ports.
