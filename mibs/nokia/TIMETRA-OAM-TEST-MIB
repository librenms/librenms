       "To facilitate the provisioning of access control by a
        security administrator using the View-Based Access
        Control Model (RFC 2575, VACM) for tables in which
        multiple users may need to independently create or
        modify entries, the initial index is used as an 'owner
        index'.  Such an initial index has a syntax of
        SnmpAdminString, and can thus be trivially mapped to a
        security name or group name as defined in VACM, in
        accordance with a security policy.
 
        When used in conjunction with such a security policy all
        entries in the table belonging to a particular user (or
        group) will have the same value for this initial index.
        For a given user's entries in a particular table, the
        object identifiers for the information in these entries
        will have the same subidentifiers (except for the 'column'
        subidentifier) up to the end of the encoded owner index.
        To configure VACM to permit access to this portion of the
        table, one would create vacmViewTreeFamilyTable entries
        with the value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree including
        the owner index portion, and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask
        'wildcarding' the column subidentifier.  More elaborate

    DESCRIPTION
        "The value of tmnxOamPingCtlSize specifies the size of the OAM Echo 
         message.  
        
         When tmnxOamPingCtlTestMode has a value of 'mtuPing', changing the
         message size is a method of checking the ability of an SDP
         to support a particular path-mtu value.  The size of the message
         does not include the SDP encapsulation, VC-Lable (if applied)
         or any DLC headers or trailers.
         
         When the OAM message is encapsulated in an IP/GRE SDP, the
         IP 'DF' (Don't Fragment) bit is set.  If any segment of the path
         between the sender and receiver cannot handle the message size,
         the message is discarded.  MPLS LSPs are not expected to fragment
         the message either, as the message contained in the LSP is not an
         IP packet.         

         In the case of 'lspPing' the minimum size allowed is 84 octets.  
         In the case of 'vccvPing' the minimum size allowed is 88 octets.
         In the case of 'sdpPing' the minimum size allowed is 72 octets. 
         Before 6.0 release, the minimum size in 'sdpPing' is 40 octets. 
         Such shorter packet has no timestamp information but should still 
         be accepted for interoperability purpose. However, new 'sdpPing' 
         should include the timestamp information.
         In the case of 'icmpPing' the minimum size allowed is 0 octet.
         In the case of 'macPing', 'mfibPing' and 'vprnPing' the minimum
         size allowed is 1 octet.

         In the case of all the test types except 'icmpPing' the maximum
         size allowed is 9198 octets. In the case of 'icmpPing' the maximum
         size allowed is 16384 octets.

         When tmnxOamPingCtlTestMode has a value of 'icmpPing', the value

       "To facilitate the provisioning of access control by a

        Control Model (RFC 2575, VACM) for tables in which
        multiple users may need to independently create or
        modify entries, the initial index is used as an 'owner
        index'.  Such an initial index has a syntax of
        SnmpAdminString, and can thus be trivially mapped to a
        security name or group name as defined in VACM, in
        accordance with a security policy.
 
        When used in conjunction with such a security policy
        all entries in the table belonging to a particular user
        (or group) will have the same value for this initial
        index.  For a given user's entries in a particular
        table, the object identifiers for the information in
        these entries will have the same subidentifiers (except
        for the 'column' subidentifier) up to the end of the
        encoded owner index. To configure VACM to permit access
        to this portion of the table, one would create
        vacmViewTreeFamilyTable entries with the value of
        vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree including the owner index
        portion, and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask 'wildcarding' the

        Control Model (RFC 2575, VACM) for tables in which
        multiple users may need to independently create or
        modify entries, the initial index is used as an 'owner
        index'.  Such an initial index has a syntax of
        SnmpAdminString, and can thus be trivially mapped to a
        security name or group name as defined in VACM, in
        accordance with a security policy.
 
        When used in conjunction with such a security policy all
        entries in the table belonging to a particular user (or
        group) will have the same value for this initial index.
        For a given user's entries in a particular table, the
        object identifiers for the information in these entries
        will have the same subidentifiers (except for the 'column'
        subidentifier) up to the end of the encoded owner index.
        To configure VACM to permit access to this portion of the
        table, one would create vacmViewTreeFamilyTable entries
        with the value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree including
        the owner index portion, and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask
        'wildcarding' the column subidentifier.  More elaborate
