                  transmitting simultaneously.  A repeater port must
                  detect a collision when two or more stations are
                  transmitting simultaneously.  Thus a probe placed on
                  a repeater port could record more collisions than a
                  probe connected to a station on the same segment
                  would.

                  Probe location plays a much smaller role when
                  considering 10BASE-T.  14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE
                  standard 802.3 defines a collision as the
                  simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD
                  circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same
                  time).  A 10BASE-T station can only detect
                  collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes
                  placed on a station and a repeater, should report
                  the same number of collisions.

                  Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater
                  should ideally report collisions between the
                  repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit
                  collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver
                  collisions observed on any coax segments to which
                  the repeater is connected."

                  the receive mode, if three or more stations are
                  transmitting simultaneously.  A repeater port must
