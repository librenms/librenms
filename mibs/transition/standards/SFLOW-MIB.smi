              STATUS      current
              DESCRIPTION
                "Identifies a source of sFlow data.

                The following data source types are currently defined:

                - ifIndex.<I>
                SFlowDataSources of this traditional form are called
                'port-based'. Ideally the sampling entity will perform 
                sampling on all flows originating from or destined to 
                the specified interface. However, if the switch architecture 
                only allows input or output sampling then the sampling agent 
                is permitted to only sample input flows input or output flows. 
                Each packet must only be considered once for sampling, 
                irrespective of the number of ports it will be forwarded to.
                Note: Port 0 is used to indicate that all ports on the device
                      are represented by a single data source.
                      - sFlowFsPacketSamplingRate applies to all ports on the
                        device capable of packet sampling.

                - smonVlanDataSource.<V>
                An SFlowDataSource of this form refers to a 'Packet-based VLAN'
                and is called a 'VLAN-based' dataSource. <V> is the VLAN
                ID as defined by the IEEE 802.1Q standard. The
                value is between 1 and 4094 inclusive, and it represents
                an 802.1Q VLAN-ID with global scope within a given
                bridged domain.
                Sampling is performed on all packets received that are part
                of the specified VLAN (no matter which port they arrived on).
                Each packet will only be considered once for sampling,
                irrespective of the number of ports it will be forwarded to.
                
                - entPhysicalEntry.<N>
                An SFlowDataSource of this form refers to a physical entity 
                within the agent (e.g. entPhysicalClass = backplane(4)) and 
                is called an 'entity-based' dataSource. Sampling is performed 
                on all packets entering the resource (e.g. If the backplane 
                is being sampled, all packets transmitted onto the backplane 
                will be considered as single candidates for sampling 
                irrespective of the number of ports they ultimately reach).

                Note: Since each SFlowDataSource operates independently a 
                      packet that crosses multiple DataSources may generate 
                      multiple flow records."

                       independently of all other instances. Setting
                       an attribute of one sampler must not alter the
                       the behavior and settings of other sampler

      SFlowReceiver ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
              STATUS       current
              DESCRIPTION
                "Identify the sFlow receiver associated with this resource.

                 A value of zero indicates that this resource is available.
                 If non-zero the value must correspond to a valid, active 
                 sFlowRcvrIndex.

                 If the value is currently zero it may be set to any
                 active entry in the sFlowRcvrTable. If the value is
                 not zero then a set to anything other than zero or
                 its current value will result in an SNMP error (bad value).

                 Setting to zero frees the resource and returns all the
                 values in this entry to their default values.

                 If an entry in the sFlowRcvrTable expires, either
                 because the sFlowRcvrOwner is set to the empty
                 string or because the sFlowRcvrTimeout reaches zero, then
                 the agent must mark all associated resources as available
                 (by setting the associated SFlowReceiver entry to zero)
                 and all values in these records must be restored to their
                 default values.

                 This mechanism provides no enforcement and relies on the
                 cooperation of management entities in order to ensure that
                 competition for a resource is fairly resolved. A management
                 entity should not make any changes to a resource
                 without first aquiring it by successfully writing its
                 sFlowRcvrIndex value as the SFlowReceiver for the resource."

                 source. 

                 Set to N to sample 1/Nth of the packets in the monitored flows.
                 An agent should choose its own algorithm to introduce variance
                 into the sampling so that exactly every Nth packet is not
                 counted. A sampling rate of 1 counts all packets. A sampling
                 rate of 0 disables sampling.
                 
                 The agent is permitted to have minimum and maximum allowable
                 values for the sampling rate. A minimum rate lets the agent
                 designer set an upper bound on the overhead associated with
                 sampling, and a maximum rate may be the result of hardware
                 restrictions (such as counter size). In addition not all values
                 between the maximum and minimum may be realizable as the 
                 sampling rate (again because of implementation considerations).

                 When the sampling rate is set the agent is free to adjust the
                 value so that it lies between the maximum and minimum values
                 and has the closest achievable value.

                 When read, the agent must return the actual sampling rate it
                 will be using (after the adjustments previously described). The
                 sampling algorithm must converge so that over time the number
                 of packets sampled approaches 1/Nth of the total number of
                 packets in the monitored flows."
