TNRowEditorState ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
        "The RowEditorState is used both as a column in the dynamic tables, and
         as a object in the row editor. The meaning of the row editor state
         depends on the context where it is used.

         In either case it is used to implement actions related to add or delete
         columns in dynamic tables.

         When used as a column in a dynamic table
         ----------------------------------------

         Read back of this value will always be zero. If the value 1 is written
         to this object the given row will be deleted. Values different from 0
         and 1 are reserved for future use and should not be used.

         When used as an object in a row editor
         --------------------------------------

         A value used to control the row editor protocol. The values 0-255 are
         reserved to be used in the row editor protocol, all other values tokes
         the manager can use to reserve the row editor.

         The values 0, 1 and 2 is currently use din the row editor protocol
         while the values 3-255 are reserved for future use.

         Following is the names of the values used in the row editor protocol:

           0:              IDLE STATE
           1:              CLEAR-ACTION
           2:              COMMIT-ACTION
           256-4294967295: MANAGER-ID

         The following state machine defines the row editor protocol:

                 +--------------+                 +------------------+
                 |              |<----------------|                  |
                 |              |   CLEAR         |                  |
                 |     IDLE     |<----------------|     RESERVED     |
                 |              |   COMMIT        |                  |
                 |              |---------------->|                  |
                 +--------------+   MANAGER-ID    +------------------+

         When the RowEditorState is being read one will either read the value
         zero: meaning that the row editor is in the idle state. Or a value
         between 256-4294967295: meaning that the row editor is reserved with
         the given ID.

         When the row editor is in the IDLE state the manager may try to reserve
         it by writing its own MANAGER-ID to the RowEditorState object. If the
         write succeeds the manager can read-back the MANAGER-ID.

         When the row editor is in the RESERVED state the manager can either
         clear the changes by writing CLEAR, or it can commit the changes by
         writing COMMIT. Both actions will cause the state to jump back to the
         IDLE state, but only the COMMIT will cause the row to be added."

TNPercent ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

TNPortList ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "128x"
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A list of ports that may be distributed across more stack units.

         The type should be interpreted as a sequence of bits, each bit
         representing a port. If a bit is set (1) the represented port is
         included in the port list. If a bit is not set (0) the represented port
         is not included in the port list.

         Each switch in a stack is represented by an ID in the range [1-16] both
         included. Each switch in the stack has a reserved range of 64 bits
         or 8 bytes in this octet string. If the switch is not stackable it will
         be represented as 'Switch 1'.

         The switch with ID 1 owns the byte range 0-7, switch ID 2 owns the
         byte range 8-15, etc.

         The physical ports are represented by the bit index relative to the
         range owned by a given switch. Bit number zero is the least significant
         bit of the first entry in the byte sequence owned by the switch (port
         number 0 if such a port exists). Bit number one is the second least
         significant bit in the first byte of the range owned by the switch.

         This is illustrated below:

          Port 7 switch 1                 Port 7 switch 2
          ^    Port 0 switch 1            ^    Port 0 switch 2
          |    ^ Port 15 switch 1         |    ^     Port 63 switch 2
          |    | ^    Port 8 switch 1     |    |     ^     Port 56 switch 2
          |    | |    ^ Port 23 switch 1       |     |     ^
          |    | |    | ^    Port 16 switch 1        |     |
          |    | |    | |    ^     Port 63 switch 1        |
          |    | |    | |    |     ^    Port 56 switch 1   |
          |    | |    | |    |     |    ^                  |
          |    | |    | |    |     |    | |    |     |     |
          v    v v    v v    v     v    v v    v     v     v

         The octet string is truncated at most significant byte which is not
         zero. An empty port list is encoded as [0x00].

         Example: a non-stackable switch where 48 is the highest port number
         needs seven bytes to represent a complete port list. If the port list
         only contains port 1, 2 and 20 then the SNMP encoded port list is:
         [0x06, 0x00, 0x10].

         NOTE: Even though port 0 does not exists in the port map it is still
         represented by a bit in this port list. The same is true for the higher
         indices. Configuring non-existing ports using the port list will have
         no effect on the target."

TNVlanListQuarter ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "128x"
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A list representing 1024 VLAN IDs.

         The type should be interpreted as a sequence of bits, each bit
         representing one VLAN ID. If a bit is set (1) the represented VLAN is
         included in the VLAN list. If a bit is not set (0) the represented VLAN
         is not included in the VLAN list.

         The least significant bit of each byte represents a smaller VLAN ID
         than a more significant bit of a byte.

         If for example the VLAN list represents VLAN IDs from 0 to 1023,
         bit 0 of the first byte represents VLAN ID 0, bit 1 of the first byte
         represents VLAN ID 1, and so on. The most significant bit of the 128th
         byte therefore represents VLAN ID 1023.

         An implementation that needs to represent all 4K VLANs will divide
         the VLAN list into four equally sized objects. VLAN ID 0 is included
         in the first object even though it is not used."

    DESCRIPTION
        "Represents a protocol encapsulation, needed by the Protocol part of
        the VCL module.

        The protocol encapsulation type, along with the respective encapsulation
        fields are encoded as an octet string of variable size ranging from 3 to 6.

        Currently, the VCL module only supports three protocol encapsulation types:

        - Ethernet II encapsulation, defined by setting the first octet to 1. Two more
          octets are used to describe the 'type' field. The type can range from 0x0600-0xffff.

          I.e. ETH2:    1            TYPE
                     {byte 0} {byte 1 +  byte 2}

          E.g. 1.2048 := ETH2, TYPE = 0x0800

        - LLC SNAP encapsulation, defined by setting the first octet to 2. Three more
          octets are used for the 'OID' field and two for the 'PID' field. The OID can range
          from 0x000000-0xffffff and the PID from 0x0000-0xffff. Special case is when OID is
          0x000000; then PID can only range from 0x0600-0xffff.

          I.e. LLC-SNAP:    2      OUI[0]   OUI[1]   OUI[2]         PID
                         {byte 0} {byte 1} {byte 2} {byte 3} {byte 4 +  byte 5}

          E.g. 2.0.1.24.562 := SNAP, OUI = 0x00:01:18, PID = 0x0232

        - LLC Other encapsulation, defined by setting the first octet to 3. Two more
          octets are used for the 'DSAP' and 'SSAP' fields respectively. Each of these two fields
          can range from 0-255

          I.e. LLC-OTHER:    3       DSAP     SSAP
                          {byte 0} {byte 1} {byte 2}

          E.g. 3.42.85 := LLC, DSAP = 0x2A, SSAP = 0x55
