              (Automatic Protection Switching) feature in a Optical 
              Channel. APS is the ability to configure a pair of Optical

              automatically switch the active connection from working connection
              to the protection connection or vice versa, within 50ms, 
              when the active connection fails.
              The optical connections are specified in the 
              optXpdConnConfigTable in the SL-OPT-MIB.
              The APS is defined be specifying two entries in this table
              the backup each other.
              The optXpdConnConfigTable defines two entries for each dircetion
              of the connection.
              Only one of the two entries is used by the optical aps table.
