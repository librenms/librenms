    SYNTAX INTEGER (0..255)

PhysicalClass ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS            current
    DESCRIPTION
            "An enumerated value which provides an indication of the
            general hardware type of a particular physical entity.
            There are no restrictions as to the number of
            slEntPhysicalEntries of each slEntPhysicalClass, which must be
            instantiated by an agent.

            The enumeration 'other' is applicable if the physical entity
            class is known, but does not match any of the supported
            values.

            The enumeration 'unknown' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is unknown to the agent.

            The enumeration 'chassis' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is an overall container for networking
            equipment.  Any class of physical entity except a stack may
            be contained within a chassis, and a chassis may only be
            contained within a stack.

            The enumeration 'backplane' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is some sort of device for aggregating and
            forwarding networking traffic, such as a shared backplane in
            a modular ethernet switch.  Note that an agent may model a
            backplane as a single physical entity, which is actually
            implemented as multiple discrete physical components (within
            a chassis or stack).

            The enumeration 'container' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is capable of containing one or more removable
            physical entities, possibly of different types. For example,
            each (empty or full) slot in a chassis will be modeled as a
            container. Note that all removable physical entities should
            be modeled within a container entity, such as field-
            replaceable modules, fans, or power supplies.  Note that all
            known containers should be modeled by the agent, including
            empty containers.

            The enumeration 'powerSupply' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is a power-supplying component.

            The enumeration 'fan' is applicable if the physical entity
            class is a fan or other heat-reduction component.

            The enumeration 'sensor' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is some sort of sensor, such as a temperature
            sensor within a router chassis.

            The enumeration 'module' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is some sort of self-contained sub-system.  If
            it is removable, then it should be modeled within a
            container entity, otherwise it should be modeled directly
            within another physical entity (e.g., a chassis or another
            module).

            The enumeration 'port' is applicable if the physical entity
            class is some sort of networking port, capable of receiving
            and/or transmitting networking traffic.

            The enumeration 'stack' is applicable if the physical entity
            class is some sort of super-container (possibly virtual),
            intended to group together multiple chassis entities.  A
            stack may be realized by a 'virtual' cable, a real
            interconnect cable, attached to multiple chassis, or may in
            fact be comprised of multiple interconnect cables. A stack
            should not be modeled within any other physical entities,
            but a stack may be contained within another stack.  Only
            chassis entities should be contained within a stack."

            "The vendor-specific serial number string for the physical
            entity.  The preferred value is the serial number string
            actually printed on the component itself (if present).

            On the first instantiation of an physical entity, the value
            of slEntPhysicalSerialNum associated with that entity is set
            to the correct vendor-assigned serial number, if this
            information is available to the agent.  If a serial number
            is unknown or non-existent, the slEntPhysicalSerialNum will be
            set to a zero-length string instead.

            Note that implementations which can correctly identify the
            serial numbers of all installed physical entities do not
            need to provide write access to the slEntPhysicalSerialNum
            object. Agents which cannot provide non-volatile storage for
            the slEntPhysicalSerialNum strings are not required to
            implement write access for this object.

            Not every physical component will have a serial number, or
            even need one.  Physical entities for which the associated
            value of the slEntPhysicalIsFRU object is equal to 'false(2)'
            (e.g., the repeater ports within a repeater module), do not
            need their own unique serial number. An agent does not have
            to provide write access for such entities, and may return a
            zero-length string.

            If write access is implemented for an instance of
            slEntPhysicalSerialNum, and a value is written into the
            instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the
            slEntPhysicalSerialNum instance associated with the same
            physical entity for as long as that entity remains
            instantiated. This includes instantiations across all re-
            initializations/reboots of the network management system,
            including those which result in a change of the physical
            entity's slEntPhysicalIndex value."

               action or per configuration information retained by
               the managed system, ifAdminStatus is then changed to
               either the up(1) or testing(3) states (or remains in
               the down(2) state).
               State warmBoot(4) cause the card a Warm Start.
               The state coldBoot(5)has two meanings. If the card is present
               it means to reinitialize it with the factory defaults. This
               is equivalent to Cold Start. 
               Setting the object to the value hotBoot(7) cause the
               card to reboot in a non service affecting manner.
               If the card is not present it means that the former
               configuration of this slot is not longer kept in the
               system. In this case the slot is ready for insertion of
               a new card of any type."

    DESCRIPTION
            "The oem-specific serial number string for the physical
            entity.  The preferred value is the serial number string
            actually printed on the component itself (if present).

            On the first instantiation of an physical entity, the value
            of slEntPhysicalSerialNum associated with that entity is set
            to the correct vendor-assigned serial number, if this
            information is available to the agent.  If a serial number
            is unknown or non-existent, the slEntPhysicalSerialNum will be
            set to a zero-length string instead.

            Note that implementations which can correctly identify the
            serial numbers of all installed physical entities do not
            need to provide write access to the slEntPhysicalSerialNum
            object. Agents which cannot provide non-volatile storage for
            the slEntPhysicalSerialNum strings are not required to
            implement write access for this object.

            Not every physical component will have a serial number, or
            even need one.  Physical entities for which the associated
            value of the slEntPhysicalIsFRU object is equal to 'false(2)'
            (e.g., the repeater ports within a repeater module), do not
            need their own unique serial number. An agent does not have
            to provide write access for such entities, and may return a
            zero-length string.

            If write access is implemented for an instance of
            slEntPhysicalSerialNum, and a value is written into the
            instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the
            slEntPhysicalSerialNum instance associated with the same
            physical entity for as long as that entity remains
            instantiated. This includes instantiations across all re-
            initializations/reboots of the network management system,
            including those which result in a change of the physical
            entity's slEntPhysicalIndex value."
