CiscoLocationSpecifier ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Use this TC to define objects that indicate the
        physical entity and/or logical interface location 
        of a managed entity on a managed device. In SNMP, a 
        standard mechanism for indicating the physical location
        of entities is via the ENTITY-MIB. However, that approach
        is not satisfactory in some cases because:

        1. The entity requiring a location-based naming may be 
           associated with an entity which can not be represented 
           as a physical entity in the ENTITY-MIB,
        2. NMS applications may desire a more direct 
           name/representation of a physical entity than is 
           available via the ENTITY-MIB, e.g., a physical entity
           which is named via a hierarchy of levels in the ENTITY-MIB.

        The value of an object defined using this TC is an ASCII 
        string consisting of zero or more elements separated by 
        commas. Each element is of the form  = . 

        An example of this syntax is 'slot=5,port=3'.

        The syntax of the string is formally specified using
        ABNF notation (with one exception, noted below), as
        follows:                 

        location-specifier =  elem *(',' elem) 
                       ; subject to 
                       ; size restriction specified in the SYNTAX
                       ; clause below

        elem    =   loctype '=' number

        number  = %x00-FFFFFFFF / %d0-4294967295

        loctype = 1*32VCHAR 

        It is recommended that loctype use one of the enumerated
        labels defined for CiscoLocationClass.

        (NOTE: To conform to ABNF notation as defined in RFC2234, 
         substitute the single-quote symbol with a double-quote 
         symbol in the above rules.)

        A zero length of CiscoLocationSpecifier is object-specific
        and must be defined as part of the description of any object
        which uses this syntax."

CiscoInetAddressMask ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

    DESCRIPTION
        "Denotes a generic Internet subnet address mask.
        The Internet subnet address mask is represented as the
        number of contiguous 1-bit from MSB (most significant bit)
        of the Internet subnet address mask.
        A CiscoInetAddressMask value is always interpreted within
        the context of an InetAddressType value. The 
        InetAddressType only object or InetAddressType with
        InetAddress objects which define the context must be
        registered immediately before the object which uses the
        CiscoInetAddressMask textual convention.  In other words,
        the object identifiers for the InetAddressType object and
        the CiscoInetAddressMask object MUST have the same length
        and the last sub-identifier of the InetAddressType object
        MUST be 1 less than the last sub-identifier of the 
        CiscoInetAddressMask object and MUST be 2 less than the
        last sub-identifier of the CiscoInetAddressMask object if
        an InetAddress object is defined between InetAddressType
        and CiscoInetAddressMask objects.
        The maximum value of the CiscoInetAddressMask TC is 32 for
        the value 'ipv4(1)' in InetAddressType object and 128 for
        the value 'ipv6(2)' in InetAddressType object.
        The value zero is object-specific and must therefore be
        defined as part of the description of any object which
        uses this syntax.  Examples of the usage of zero might
        include situations where Internet subnet mask was unknown,
        or when none subnet masks need to be referenced."

PerfHighIntervalCount ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A 64 bit counter associated with a
        performance measurement in a previous
        15 minute measurement interval. In the
        case where the agent has no valid data
        available for a particular interval the
        corresponding object instance is not
        available and upon a retrieval request
        a corresponding error message shall be
        returned to indicate that this instance
        does not exist (for example, a noSuchName
        error for SNMPv1 and a noSuchInstance for
        SNMPv2 GET operation).
        In a system supporting
        a history of n intervals with
        IntervalCount(1) and IntervalCount(n) the
        most and least recent intervals
        respectively, the following applies at
        the end of a 15 minute interval:
            - discard the value of IntervalCount(n)
            - the value of IntervalCount(i) becomes that
              of IntervalCount(i-1) for n >= i > 1
            - the value of IntervalCount(1) becomes that
              of CurrentCount
            - the TotalCount, if supported, is adjusted.

        This definition is based on CounterBasedGauge64 TEXTUAL
        CONVENTION  defined in RFC2856. The PerfHighIntervalCount
        type represents a non-negative
        integer, which may increase or decrease, but shall never
        exceed a maximum value, nor fall below a minimum value. The
        maximum value can not be greater than 2^64-1
        (18446744073709551615 decimal), and the minimum value can
        not be smaller than 0.  The value of a PerfHighIntervalCount,
        has its maximum value whenever the information being modeled
        is greater than or equal to its maximum value, and has its
        minimum value whenever the information being modeled is
        smaller than or equal to its minimum value.  If the
        information being modeled subsequently decreases below
        (increases above) the maximum (minimum) value, the
        PerfHighIntervalCount also decreases (increases).

        Note that this TC is not strictly supported in SMIv2,
        because the 'always increasing' and 'counter wrap' semantics
        associated with the Counter64 base type are not preserved.
        It is possible that management applications which rely
        solely upon the (Counter64) ASN.1 tag to determine object
        semantics will mistakenly operate upon objects of this type
        as they would for Counter64 objects.

        This textual convention represents a limited and short-term
        solution, and may be deprecated as a long term solution is
        defined and deployed to replace it."

ConfigIterator ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This object type is a control object type which applies to
        writable objects in the same SNMP PDU related to the
        same table containing those objects. It controls an 
        operation which repeatedly applies the specified 
        configuration data to more than one rows in a table. 
        The operation starts from the row specified by the index 
        of the instance and repeats for the number of rows as 
        the value of the object. 

        ConfigIterator object needs to be accompanied by one set of
        writable objects which are of the same instance to apply to.

        For example, a SNMP PDU contains 
           { objectA.10 = 1, 
             objectB.10 = 'E1',
             objectC.10 = 44,
             objectRepetition.10 = 100 }

        The SYNTAX of objectRepetition is ConfigIterator.
        This will apply value 1 to objectA, value 'E1' to objectB,
        value 44 to objectC in the table starting from row 10 
        repeatedly for 100 rows.

        The iteration is based on the number of rows, not based on
        the value of the index. For sparse tables, the index 10, 
        20, 30, 110, and 120 counts for 5 rows, the operation will 
        go beyond index 100 in the previous SNMP PDU example.

        The iteration will stop prematurely when it comes to the 
        following situations:
        (1) When the number of the rows in the table is less than
            the designated row indicated by the ConfigIterator 
            object. 
        (2) When it encounters the first error in any row, the 
            operation won't continue to next row.

        The operation of ConfigIterator object applies only to
        the writable objects having the same index as the
        ConfigIterator object in one SNMP PDU.

        For example, a SNMP PDU contains
           { objectD.5 = 38,
             objectE.6 = 'T1',
             objectF.5 = 'false',
             objectIterator.5 = 10 }

        The SYNTAX of objectIterator is ConfigIterator.
        This will apply value 38 to objectD, value 'false' to 
        objectF in the table starting from row 5 repeatedly 
        for 10 rows. Since the object objectE.6 has different
        index (6) from the index of objectIterator, the 
        repetition won't be applied to it. However the value 
        of objectE in the row 6 will be set to 'T1' according
        to regular SNMP SET orperation. 

        If there is row overlapping of the iteration in a SNMP PDU,
        it will be operated as they are in two different SNMP PDUs.

        For example, a SNMP PDU contains
           { objectD.5 = 38,
             objectD.6 = 40,
             objectE.6 = 'T1',
             objectF.5 = 'false',
             objectIterator.5 = 10
             objectIterator.6 = 10 }

        This will apply value 38 to objectD, value 'false' to 
        objectF starting from row 5 repeatedly for 10 rows, and
        apply value 40 to objectD, value 'T1' to objectE starting
        from row 6 repeatedly for 10 rows. The final value of 
        objectD.6 can be 38 or 40, it depends on the SNMP stack of
        the system starts SNMP SET for the row 5 before the row 6 
        or the other way around.

        The object defined as ConfigIterator will be set to value 1 
        after the iteration operation is kick-off regardless the 
        system has completed the operation to the designated rows 
        or not. Therefore retrieving the value of this object 
        is meaningless. It acts as the one time operation for 
        bulk configuration.

        The object defined as ConfigIterator has no meaning by itself,
        it has to be combined with one or more than one writable 
        objects from the same table and within the same SNMP PDU
        for the repetition operation.

        For example, a SNMP PDU contains
           { objectG.2 = 49,
             objectH.2 = 'AE'h
             objectIterator.4 = 20 }

        The SYNTAX of objectIterator is ConfigIterator. Since
        there are no objects having the same index as the index
        of objectIterator in the PDU, the result of this SNMP 
        operation will set value 49 to objectG and value 0xAE 
        to objectH of the row 2 only as regular SNMP SET operation.

        The index of the instance indicates the starting row for the
        iteration. 
        The order of the iteration depends, for instance, on: 
        (1) physical hardware position, or
        (2) logical index.

        It depends on the characters of the table which contains
        the ConfigIterator object.

        Iteration can be done through some or all the components
        of the index for a table. The description of the iterator
        object in that table should describe which part of the 
        index the iteration is applied to.

        The operation for this object type is based on the best
        effort. When the agent receives a SNMP PDU containing this 
        data type, the return status of the SNMP request reflects 
        only the result of the SET operation has applied to the 
        starting row. It may return a SNMP response with SUCCESS 
        status regardless the number of rows for the data actually 
        been deployed later on. Therefore it is possible the data 
        might not be completely deployed to the number of rows
        designated by the ConfigIterator and the operation stops 
        prematurely due to an error it first encounters after 
        n rows (n < the value of ConfigIterator object).

        Usually the error report mechanism for this type of operation
        is accomplished by combining this type of object with the
        other two objects in the same table:

        (1) An OwnerString object
        (2) An object indicates the result of the operation.

        When issuing this bulk configuration request, the SNMP 
        manager should provide its identifier in (1) object.
        After issuing the request, it should check the value of (1) 
        object if it is the same with it own name.
        If they are the same, then the value of the object presents
        in (2) is the result from the previous operation from this
        manager. Otherwise, another SNMP manager might issue
        the bulk configuration to the same table before the previous
        bulk operation has been completed. These two objects will 
        represent the last bulk operation in the table."

        "Each octet within this value specifies a set of eight
        ports. The object defined by this textual convention
        can specify a port range of 2k ports in its description.
        Example: 1 - 2048, 2049 - 4096, etc. The first octet 
        represents the first 8 ports of the range of ports
        specified by the object, the second octet represents 
        the next 8 ports, etc. When a port range is not
        specified, a default port range of '1 - 2048' is assumed.

        Within each octet, the most significant bit represents
        the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit
        represents the highest numbered port. Thus, each port
        of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the
        value of this object.  If that bit has a value of '1'
        then that port is included in the set of ports; the port
        is not included if its bit has a value of '0'.

        Note that if the length of this string is less than
        256 octets, any 'missing' octets are assumed to contain
        the value zero. An NMS may omit any zero-valued octets
        from the end of this string in order to reduce SetPDU size,
        and the agent may also omit zero-valued trailing octets,
        to reduce the size of GetResponse PDUs."

CiscoVlanList ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Each octet within this value specifies a set of eight
        VLANs. The object defined by this textual convention
        can specify a VLAN range of 1k VLANs in its description.
        Example: 0 - 1023, 1024 - 2047, etc. The first octet
        represents the first 8 VLANs of the range of VLANs
        specified by the object, the second octet represents
        the next 8 VLANs, etc. When a VLAN range is not
        specified, a default VLAN range of '0 - 1023' is assumed.

        Within each octet, the most significant bit represents
        the lowest numbered VLAN, and the least significant bit
        represents the highest numbered VLAN. Thus, each VLAN
        of the device is represented by a single bit within the
        value of this object.  If that bit has a value of '1'
        then that VLAN is included in the set of VLANs; the VLAN
        is not included if its bit has a value of '0'.

        Note that if the length of this string is less than
        128 octets, any 'missing' octets are assumed to contain
        the value zero. An NMS may omit any zero-valued octets
        from the end of this string in order to reduce SetPDU size,
        and the agent may also omit zero-valued trailing octets,
        to reduce the size of GetResponse PDUs."

        range of 2k VLANs in its description. Example: 0 - 2047, 2048 -
        4095, etc. The first octet represents the first 8 VLANs of the
        range of VLANs specified by the object, the second octet
        represents the next 8 VLANs, etc.

        Within each octet, the most significant bit represents the
        lowest numbered VLAN, and the least significant bit represents
        the highest numbered VLAN. Thus, each VLAN of the device is
        represented by a single bit within the value of this object. If
        that bit has a value of '1' then that VLAN is included in the
        set of VLANs; the VLAN is not included if its bit has a value of
        '0'.

        Note that if the length of this string is less than 256 octets,
        any 'missing' octets are assumed to contain the value zero. An
        NMS may omit any zero-valued octets from the end of this string
        in order to reduce SetPDU size, and the agent may also omit
        zero-valued trailing octets, to reduce the size of GetResponse
        PDUs."

    DESCRIPTION
        "This textual convention contains a list of ifIndex values.

        Each ifIndex value is represented by four octets.
        Every set of four octets represents a value of an instance
        of ifIndex object, defined in IF-MIB, corresponding to a
        particular interface.

        For example, the first octet to the fourth octet represent a 
        value of the instance of ifIndex object for the first 
        interface in the list.  The fifth octet to the eighth octet 
        represent a value of the instance of ifIndex object for
        the second interface in the list.

        Up to 64 interfaces can be represented by this textual

        For example, the first octet to the fourth octet
        represents a value of the instance of entPhysicalIndex object
        for the first physical entity in the list. The fifth octet to
        the eighth octet represents a value of the instance of
        entPhysicalIndex object for the second physical entity in the
