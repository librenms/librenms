    DESCRIPTION
        "The requested number of discrete time intervals

        When this object is created or modified, the probe
        should set rlHistoryControlBucketsGranted as closely to
        this object as is possible for the particular probe
        implementation and available resources."

rlHistoryControlBucketsGranted OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX INTEGER (1..65535)

        "The number of discrete sampling intervals
        over which data shall be saved in the part of
        the rlHistory table associated with this
        rlHistoryControlEntry.

        When the associated rlHistoryControlBucketsRequested
        object is created or modified, the probe
        should set this object as closely to the requested
        value as is possible for the particular
        probe implementation and available resources.  The
        probe must not lower this value except as a result
        of a modification to the associated
        rlHistoryControlBucketsRequested object.

        There will be times when the actual number of
        buckets associated with this entry is less than
        the value of this object.  In this case, at the
        end of each sampling interval, a new bucket will
        be added to the rlHistory  table.

        When the number of buckets reaches the value of
        this object and a new bucket is to be added to the
        media-specific table, the oldest bucket associated
        with this rlHistoryControlEntry shall be deleted by
        the agent so that the new bucket can be added.

        When the value of this object changes to a value less
        than the current value, entries are deleted
        from the rlHistory table. Enough of the oldest of these
        entries shall be deleted by the agent so that their
        number remains less than or equal to the new value of
        this object.

        When the value of this object changes to a value
        greater than the current value, the number of
        associated rlHistory table entries may be allowed to
        grow."

rlHistoryControlInterval OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX INTEGER (1..3600)

    DESCRIPTION
        "The interval in seconds over which the data is
        sampled for each bucket in the part of the
        rlHistory table associated with this
        rlHistoryControlEntry.  This interval can
        be set to any number of seconds between 1 and
        3600 (1 hour).

        Because the counters in a bucket may overflow at their
        maximum value with no indication, a prudent manager
        will take into account the possibility of overflow
        in any of the associated counters.  It is important
        to consider the minimum time in which any counter
        could overflow and set the rlHistoryControlInterval object to a value
        This object may not be modified if the associated
        rlHistoryControlStatus object is equal to valid(1)."

        the first sample of the history at a time such that
        when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is
        started at that instant.  Note that following this
        rule may require the probe to delay collecting the
        first sample of the history, as each sample must be
        of the same interval.  Also note that the sample which
        is currently being collected is not accessible in this
        table until the end of its interval."
