                          GLOSSARY 

                Access point    
                    Transmitter/receiver (transceiver) device
                    that commonly connects and transports data 
                    between a wireless network and a wired network.
                
                Association
                    The service used to establish access point
                    or station mapping and enable STA invocation
                    of the distribution system services.
                    (Wireless clients attempt to connect to 
                    access points.)
                
                Basic Rate
                    A data rate that is mandatory for client
                    devices to support in order for them to achieve
                    successful association.

                Basic Service Set
                    The IEEE 802.11 BSS of an AP comprises of the 
                    stations directly associating with the AP.

                Bridge    
                    Device that connects two or more segments 
                    and reduces traffic by analyzing the 
                    destination address, filtering the frame,
                    and forwarding the frame to all connected 
                    segments.
                
                Bridge AP 
                    It is an AP that functions as a transparent 
                    bridge between 2 wired LAN segments.  

                Broadcast SSID 
                    Clients can send out Broadcast SSID Probe 
                    Requests to a nearby AP, and the AP will 
                    broadcast its own SSID within its beacons
                    to response to the clients. Clients can use
                    this Broadcast SSID to associate and 
                    communicate with the AP.  

                Cyclic Redundancy Check 
                    CRC is an error detect mechanism that applies 
                    to frame transmission.
                
                Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum
                    DSSS combines a data signal at the sending 
                    station with a higher data rate bit sequence, 
                    which many refer to as a chipping code (also 
                    known as processing gain).  A high processing gain
                    increases the signals resistance to interference.  
                    DSSS sends a specific string of bits for each data
                    bit sent.

                ERP-CCK Modulation
                    This signal modulation technique is supported in
                    PHY implementing IEEE 802.11b/g Protocol.
                
                ERP-OFDM Modulation
                    This signal modulation technique is supported in
                    PHY implementing IEEE 802.11g Protocol.         

                Extensible Authentication Protocol
                    EAP acts as the interface between a wireless 
                    client and an authentication server, such as a 
                    RADIUS server, to which the access point 
                    communicates over the wired network.

                Extended Rate PHY
                    This PHY implements the IEEE 802.11g Protocol.

                Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum
                    In FHSS, a hopping code determines the frequencies 
                    the radio will transmit and in which order.  To 
                    properly receive the signal, the receiver must be 
                    set to same hopping code and listen to the 
                    incoming signal at the right time and correct 
                    frequency.  The code pattern maintains a single 
                    logical channel.
                
                IEEE 802.11    
                    Standard to encourage interoperability among 
                    wireless networking equipment.
                
                IEEE 802.11b    
                    High-rate wireless LAN standard for wireless 
                    data transfer at up to 11 Mbps.
                
                IEEE P802.11g 
                    Higher Speed Physical Layer (PHY) Extension to 
                    IEEE 802.11b, will boost wireless LAN speed to 54 
                    Mbps by using OFDM (orthogonal frequency division 
                    multiplexing).  The IEEE 802.11g specification is 
                    backward compatible with the widely deployed IEEE 
                    802.11b standard.

                Inter-Access-Point Protocol 
                    The IEEE 802.11 standard does not define how 
                    access points track moving users or how to 
                    negotiate a handoff from one access point to the
                    next, a process referred to as roaming.  IAPP is
                    a Cisco proprietary protocol to support roaming.  
                    However, IAPP does not address how the wireless 
                    system tracks users moving from one subnet to 
                    another.
                
                Independent network    
                    Network that provides peer-to-peer connectivity 
                    without relying on a complete network 
                    infrastructure.
                
                Integrity Check Value
                    The WEP ICV shall be a 32-bit value containing
                    the 32-bit cyclic redundancy code designed for 
                    verifying wireless data frame integrity.   

                Message Integrity Check 
                    A MIC can, optionally, be added to WEP-encrypted 
                    802.11 frames.  MIC prevents attacks on encrypted 
                    packets.  MIC, implemented on both the access point 
                    and all associated client devices, adds a few bytes
                    to each packet to make the packets tamper-proof.  
                
                Native VLAN ID
                    A switch port and/or AP can be configured with a 
                    'native VLAN ID'.  Untagged or priority-tagged 
                    frames are implicitly associated with the native 
                    VLAN ID.  The default native VLAN ID is '1' if 
                    VLAN tagging is enabled.  The native VLAN ID is '0' 
                    or 'no VLAN ID' if VLAN tagging is not enabled.
                
                Node    
                    Device on a network; has its own unique network 
                    address and name.
                
                Non-Root Bridge 
                    This wireless bridge does not connect to the main 
                    wired LAN segment.  It connects to a remote wired 
                    LAN segment and can associate with root bridges and 
                    other non-root bridges that accept client 
                    associations.  It also can accept associations from
                    other non-root bridges, repeater access points, 
                    and client devices.
                
                Physical Layer Convergence Procedure
                    In IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs, PLCP defines a method 
                    of mapping the IEEE 802.11 MAC sublayer protocol
                    data units into a framing format suitable for
                    sending and receiving user data and management
                    information between two or more wireless stations
                    using the associated PMD system.  

                Physical Medium Dependent
                    In IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs, a PMD system, whose
                    function defines the characteristics of, and method 
                    of transmitting and receiving data through, a 
                    wireless medium between two or more wireless 
                    stations each using the DSSS.

                Preamble
                    The radio preamble are data at the head of a 
                    packet that contains information access points 
                    and client devices required by IEEE 802.11 when 
                    sending and receiving packets.

                Primary LAN
                    In an AP, if the destinations of inbound unicast 
                    frames are unknown, the frames are sent toward 
                    the primary LAN defined on the device.
                
                Radio carrier    
                    Radio waves that deliver energy to a remote 
                    receiver; in other words, radio waves in a 
                    wireless LAN environment.
                
                Repeater    
                    Device that connects multiple segments, 
                    listening to each and regenerating the signal
                    on one to every other connected one; so that 
                    the signal can travel further.
                
                Repeater or Non-root Access Point    
                    The repeater access point is not connected 
                    to the wired LAN.  The Repeater is a wireless 
                    LAN transceiver that transfers data between 
                    a client and another access point, another 
                    repeater, or between two bridges.  The repeater 
                    is placed within radio range of an access point 
                    connected to the wired LAN, another repeater, or 
                    an non-root bridge to extend the range of the 
                    infrastructure.
                
                Radio Frequency 
                    Radio wave and modulation process or operation.
 
                Root Access Point    
                    This access point connects clients to the main 
                    wired LAN.
                
                Root (Wireless) Bridge    
                    This wireless bridge connects to the main wired 
                    LAN.  It can communicate with non-root wireless 
                    bridges, repeater access points, and client 
                    devices but not with another wireless root 
                    bridge.  Only one wireless bridge in a wireless 
                    LAN can be set as the wireless root bridge.  
                
                Spread-spectrum 
                    Wideband radio frequency technique that 
                    consumes more bandwidth than the narrow-band 
                    alternative but produces a signal that is louder 
                    and easier to detect.  There are two types of 
                    spread-spectrum radio: frequency hopping and 
                    direct sequence.

                    SSID is a unique identifier that APs and clients 
                    use to identify with each other.  SSID is a simple 
                    means of access control and is not for security.  
                    The SSID can be any alphanumeric entry up to 32 
                    characters.
                
                Tag header
                    A 'tag header' is as defined in the IEEE 802.1Q
                    standard.  An 802.1Q tag header contains a 3-bit 
                    priority field and a 12-bit VLAN ID field.   
                    A 'priority tag' has a VLAN ID of 0, to indicate 
                    'no VLAN ID'.  A 'VLAN tag' has a non-zero 
                    VLAN ID.
                
                Virtual LAN
                    VLAN defined in the IEEE 802.1Q VLAN standard 
                    supports logically segmenting of LAN 
                    infrastructure into different subnets or 
                    workgroups so that packets are switched only 
                    between ports within the same VLAN.  
                
                VLAN ID
                    Each VLAN is identified by a 12-bit 'VLAN ID'.   
                    A VLAN ID of '0' is used to indicate 
                    'no VLAN ID'.  Valid VLAN IDs range from '1' to 
                    '4095'.  VLAN of ID '4095' is the default VLAN 
                    for Cisco VoIP Phones.
                
                Wired Equivalent Privacy
                    WEP is generally used to refer to 802.11 
                    encryption.

                Work-group Bridge
                    It is a client to APs or wireless root bridges.
                    The radio port of a WGB serves as the uplink to
                    the main network and the Ethernet port provides
                    network access for devices like PC or IP phone.

                Upgrade of Frequencies
                    As per the latest regulations proposed by the 
                    Japanese Government, the four channels 34
                    ( 5170 GHz ), 38 ( 5190 GHz), 42 ( 5210 ) and 
                    44 ( 5230 ) in the 5150-5250 MHz band has been
                    shifted by 10 MHz. Thus, the new channels in the
                    5150-5250 MHz band  are 36 ( 5180 ), 40 ( 5200 )
                    and 44 ( 5220 ) and 48 ( 5240 )."
