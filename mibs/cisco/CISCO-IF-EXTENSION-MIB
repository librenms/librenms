    DESCRIPTION
        "A MIB module for extending the IF-MIB (RFC2863)
        to add objects which provide additional information
        about interfaces not available in other MIBS.
        This MIB replaces the OLD-CISCO-INTERFACES-MIB.

        GLOSSARY :

        Virtual Switch - A physical switch partitioned into 
                multiple logical switches.

        Interface Sharing - An interface can be shared among 
                multiple virtual switches.

        Speed Group - An interface is capable of operating in any one of
        the speed range depending on the capability of the hardware.

        Virtual Link (VL) - Virtual Link is a logical connectivity 
            between two end points. A physical interface can 
            have multiple Virtual Links.

        No Drop Virtual Link - According to 802.3 standard, 
            No drop specifies lossless service on a virtual link.

        Drop Virtual Link - According to 802.3 standard,
            Traffic drop may occur on this virtual Link."

        set of 64 interfaces in a module.

        Each 4 bytes within the value of an object of this
        type is combined together to represent the interface
        index of a particular port in the module (i.e., each
        4 byte group represents the 'ifIndex' of an interface).

        The first 4 bytes (byte 1, byte 2, byte 3 and byte 4)
        combined represent the 'ifIndex' of an interface.
        While the second 4 bytes (byte 5, byte 6, byte 7 and
        byte 8) represent the 'ifIndex' for the next interface
        in the module, and so on.

        If there are only 'n' interfaces in a set of 64
        interfaces in the module, then bytes after the '4n'

    DESCRIPTION
        "This textual convention defines the operational mode

        The operational mode of an interface is represented
        by the value defined in the textual convention
        'InterfaceOperMode' (defined in CISCO-ST-TC).

        Each 'byte' within the value of an object of this
        type, specifies the operational mode of an interface
        in the module.

        The first byte (byte 1) represents the operational
        mode of an interface in the module, whose 'ifIndex'
        is represented by the corresponding instance of
        'cieInterfacesIndex' object in its first 4 bytes.

        The second byte (byte 2) represents the operational
        mode of an interface in the module, whose 'ifIndex'
        is represented by the corresponding instance of
        'cieInterfacesIndex' object in its second 4 bytes.

        If there are only 'n' interfaces in a set of 64

    DESCRIPTION
        "This textual convention defines the operational
        status cause for a set of 64 interfaces in a module.

        The operational status cause of an interface is
        represented by the value defined in the textual
        convention 'IfOperStatusReason' (defined in CISCO-TC).

        Each 2 bytes within the value of an object of this
        type is combined together to represent the operational
        status cause of a particular interface in the module
        (i.e., each 2 byte group represents the
        'cieIfOperStatusCause' of an interface).

        The first 2 bytes (byte 1 and byte 2) of this object,
        represents the operational status cause of an
        interface in the module, whose 'ifIndex' is
        represented by the corresponding instance of

        interface in the module, whose 'ifIndex' is
        represented by the corresponding instance of
        'cieInterfacesIndex' object in the next 4 bytes

    DESCRIPTION
        "This textual convention defines the status for a set of

        interface is administratively assigned a name of the current 
        owner of the interface resource as per the object cieIfOwner,
        defined on that interface. 

        Each 'bit' within the value of an object of this type, 
        specifies whether the corresponding interface on the module 
        has been administratively assigned a name of the current
        owner of the interface resource. In other words, each bit 
        represents whether the corresponding interface is 'owned' 
        or not. This bit is set to 1 if the interface is owned. 
        It is 0 otherwise.

        The first bit (bit 1) in byte 1 represents whether the 
        interface, whose 'ifIndex' is represented by the corresponding 
        instance of 'cieInterfacesIndex' object in its first 4 bytes, 
        is owned or not.

        The second byte (byte 2) in byte 2 represents whether the 
        interface, whose 'ifIndex' is represented by the corresponding 
        instance of 'cieInterfacesIndex' object in its second 4 bytes, 
        is owned or not.

        If there are only 'n' interfaces in a set of 64 interfaces in 
        the module, then bits after the 'n' bit in this object are
