-- Modification of Global VLAN Information
--   
-- To change the global information on current VLANs, including
-- creating, modifying or deleting them,
-- . the current VLAN information is copied to the "Edit buffer",
-- . the information in the Edit buffer is modified as appropriate,
-- . an 'apply' is invoked to attempt to instanciate the modified
-- contents of the Edit Buffer as the new global VLAN information.
--   
-- Only one manager can edit the Edit Buffer at a time.  So, a
-- request to copy the current VLAN information into the Edit Buffer
-- must fail if the Edit Buffer is already in use (i.e., is not empty).
-- Thus, concurrent attempts by multiple managers to gain use of the
-- Edit Buffer are resolved according to whichever of them succeeds
-- in performing a successful copy.  An OwnerString object provides
-- information on which manager currently has access.
--   
-- Ownership of the Edit Buffer terminates when a NMS explicitly
-- releases it, or when a deadman-timer expires.  The deadman-timer
-- has a fixed expiry interval of 5 minutes.  The deadman-timer is
-- automatically started on a successful copy operation.  The
-- restartTimer operation allows an NMS to restart the deadman-timer
-- if it wishes to retain ownership of the Edit Buffer for longer
-- than 5 minutes.  The deadman-timer ceases when the apply operation
-- is invoked, and is restarted when the apply operation terminates.
-- Restarting the deadman-timer after termination of the apply
-- operation allows the results of the apply operation to be retained
-- until the requesting manager has retrieved them, but for only a
-- limited amount of time.
--   
-- When managementDomainVersionInUse is version1(1) or version2(2),
-- the local device with managementDomainLocalMode as server(2)
-- could change the global VLAN configuration by editing the VLAN
-- information in the edit buffer and then apply it. However,
-- when managementDomainVersionInUse is in version3(4), there
-- are two different VTP servers, the primary server and the
-- secondary server. The global VLAN configuration could only
-- be changed by a primary server for VLAN database. The
-- secondary server may still do the 'copy' operation and edit
-- the VLAN information in the edit buffer. But in order to make
-- a possibly successful 'apply' operation, the local device must
-- be a VLAN database primary server. Otherwise, the 'apply' will
-- fail and vtpVlanApplyStatus will be set to the error status
-- 'notPrimaryServer'.

        to its own identifier (e.g., its own IP address).

    DESCRIPTION
        "For devices that allows dynamic determination of whether
        a link between two switches should be a trunk or not, this
        object allows the operator to mandate the behavior of that
        dynamic mechanism.

        on(1) dictates that the interface will always be a
        trunk. This is the value for static entries (those that
        show no dynamic behavior). If the negotiation is supported
        on this port, negotiation will take place with the far end
        to attempt to bring the far end into trunking state.

        off(2) allows an operator to specify that the specified
        interface is never to be trunk, regardless of any dynamic
        mechanisms to the contrary.  This value is useful for
        overriding the default behavior of some switches. If the
        negotiation is supported on this port, negotiation will take
        place with the far end to attempt on the link to bring the
        far end into non-trunking state.

        desirable(3) is used to indicate that it is desirable for
        the interface to become a trunk.  The device will initiate
        any negotiation necessary to become a trunk but will not
        become a trunk unless it receives confirmation from the far
        end on the link.

        auto(4) is used to indicate that the interface is capable
        and willing to become a trunk but will not initiate
        trunking negotiations.  The far end on the link are
        required to either start negotiations or start sending
        encapsulated packets, on which event the specified
        interface will become a trunk.

        onNoNegotiate(5) is used to indicate that the interface is
        permanently set to be a trunk, and no negotiation takes
        place with the far end on the link to ensure consistent
        operation. This is similar to on(1) except no negotiation
        takes place with the far end.

        If the port does not support negotiation or its
        vlanTrunkPortEncapsulationType is set to negotiate(5),
        onNoNegotiate(5) is not allowed.

        Devices that do no support dynamic determination (for just
        a particular interface, encapsulation or for the whole
        device) need only support the 'on', and 'off' values."

        By default, the object has the value as a zero-length

        to this value automatically when the password 
        (vtpAuthPassword) is set to a zero-length octet string.

        The secret key can be either generated using
        the password or configured by the user. Once
        the secret key is configured by the user, it is
        stored as a hexadecimal string in the device's
        configuration and the password is considered to be
        the secret key's matching password and hidden
        from the configuration automatically.

        This object is not allowed to be set at the same
        time when vtpAuthPassword is set.
