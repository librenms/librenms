    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB is for managing Wide Area Network (WAN) Optimization
        systems. The objective of WAN optimization system is to reduce
        as much traffic as possible on WAN link and improve the
        application response time for various applications, which gets
        affected due to bandwidth, packet loss, congestion and latency
        limitations of WAN link. WAN optimization system is generally
        peer based system. They are located at both end of WAN link and
        peer with each other to perform optimization. This MIB provides
        instrumentation for monitoring statistics for various features
        implemented for WAN optimization. WAN optimization features
        includes TCP protocol optimizations and various Application
        Optimizers (AOs). AOs include SMB AO, HTTP AO, CIFS AO, NFS AO,
        MAPI AO, VIDEO AO, SSL AO and EPM AO.

        Acronyms and Terminology used in this MIB are:
        AO               : Application Optimizer
        TFO              : Traffic Flow Optimization
        SMB              : Server Message Block
        CIFS             : Common Internet File System
        HTTP             : Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
        NFS              : Network File System
        SSL              : Secure Socket Layer
        MAPI             : Messaging Application Programming Interface
        EPM              : End Point Mapper
        RA               : Read Ahead
        MD               : Meta Data
        PT               : Pass Through
        AD               : Auto Discovery
        RTT              : Round Trip Time
        Conn             : Connections
        File Server      : SMB/CIFS file server
        peer             : It refers to peer WAN optimization system 
                           located on other end of WAN and registered 
                           with this device to optimize the traffic.
        SharePoint       : SharePoint is a Microsoft Application that 
                           provides a collaborative environment for 
                           using Microsoft Office and related 
                           applications. Typical deployments of 
                           Microsoft SharePoint use one or more        
                           SharePoint servers in a server farm for 
                           scalability. The actual data for the various
                           documents, etc. are usually stored in a 
                           backend database. The SharePoint server(s) 
                           communicate with the backend database using 
                           SharePoint Back-end protocols. Clients 
                           (either Microsoft Office Applications like 
                           Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Web Browsers) 
                           typically connect to the SharePoint server 
                           and communicate using SOAP over HTTP.
        Fast Connections : End to end connections which uses existing 
                           TCP connection over WAN and reconstructs
                           only LAN connection is fast connection.
        DRE              : Data Redundancy Elimination.
        LZ               : Lemple-Ziv data compression.
        PLZ             : Persistent Lemple-Ziv data compression."
