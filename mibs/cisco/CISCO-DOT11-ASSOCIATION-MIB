        DESCRIPTION
                "This MIB module provides network management 
                information on IEEE 802.11 wireless device 
                association management and data packet forwarding 
                configuration and statistics.  This MIB is an
                extension to the IEEE802dot11-MIB and provides
                per client based information.  

                The IEEE802dot11-MIB is defined in the IEEE Std 
                802.11-Jan 14 1999, Wireless LAN Medium Access 
                Control and Physical Layer Specifications, by the
                LAN MAN Standards Committee of the IEEE Computer
                Society.


                          GLOSSARY and ACRONYMS 

                
                Access point (AP)   
                    Transmitter/receiver (transceiver) device
                    that commonly connects and transports data 
                    between a wireless network and a wired network.
                
                AES
                    Advanced Encryption Standard

                Association
                    The service used to establish access point
                    or station mapping and enable STA invocation
                    of the distribution system serivces.
                    (Wireless clients attempt to connect to 
                    access points.)
                
                Bridge    
                    Device that connects two or more segments 
                    and reduces traffic by analyzing the 
                    destination address, filtering the frame,
                    and forwarding the frame to all connected 
                    segments.
                
                Bridge AP 
                    It is an AP that functions as a transparent 
                    bridge between 2 wired LAN segments.  
                
                Bridge Host     
                    This is also known as Work Group Bridge.  This
                    is a non-root bridge that is connected to a
                    remote LAN segment and will only communicate 
                    with repeaters or root bridges.  It does not 
                    accept association from other wireless devices.

                BSS
                    IEEE 802.11 Basic Service Set (Radio Cell).  The
                    BSS of an AP comprises of the stations directly 
                    associated with the AP.

                CCX 
                    Cisco Compatible eXtensions

                    A set of specifications which when implemented
                    would make a client radio interoperable with a
                    Cisco WLAN infrastructure and make best use of the
                    innovations for enhanced security, mobility,
                    quality of service and network management.

                CCMP
                    Code Mode/CBC Mac Protocol

                Client (Client Station)    
                    A wireless device in a wireless network 
                    associated with an access point.

                Direct Sequence Spread Sprectrum ( DSSS )

                    DSSS is a method to send data where the 
                    transmitting and receiving systems operate at
                    frequencies as wide as 22MHz.  The wide channels
                    help the participating systems to send more
                    information at higher data rates than the FSSS
                    systems.

                EAP
                    Extensible Authentication Protocol

                    Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport
                    Layer Security

                Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum ( FSSS )

                    FSSS systems hop from one frequency to another in
                    the allowed band of frequencies during the data
                    transmission.  83 MHz is specified as the allowed
                    band of frequencies in the 2.4 GHz spectrum.

                IEEE 802.11    
                    Standard to encourage interoperability among 
                    wireless networking equipment.
               
                IEEE 802.11b

                    The IEEE 802.11b standard describes DSSS systems
                    that operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band at data
                    rates of 1, 2, 5,5 and 11 Mbps.

                IEEE 802.11a

                    The IEEE 802.11a standard describes wireless LAN
                    operation in the 5 GHz UNII band at data rates
                    of 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 54 Mbps.

                IEEE 802.11g

                    This standard specifies operation in 2.4 GHz ISM
                    band at data rates of 6, 9, 12, 18. 24, 36, 48 and
                    54 Mbps.

                Industrial, Scientific and Medical band (ISM)

                    A license-free band specified by the Federal
                    Communications Commission for use by the wireless
                    LAN systems.  The ISM bands are located starting
                    at 902 MHz, 2.4GHz and 5.8 GHz.
 
                MIC
                    Message Integrity Check.  A MIC can, optionally, 
                    be added to WEP-encrypted 802.11 frames.
                
                Non-Root Bridge   
                    This wireless bridge does not connect to the main
                    wired LAN segment.  It connects to a remote wired 
                    LAN segment and can associate to root bridges and
                    other non-root bridges that accept client 
                    associations.  It also can accept associations 
                    from other non-root bridges, repeater access 
                    points, and client devices.

                PCI
                    Peripheral Component Interconnect

                    A local bus standard developed by Intel
                    Corporation. Most modern PCs include a PCI bus.
                    PCI is a 64-bit bus, though it is usually
                    implemented as a 32-bit bus. It can run at clock
                    speeds of 33 or 66 MHz. At 32 bits and 33 MHz, it
                    yields a throughput rate of 133 MBps.
                
                Repeater    
                    Device that connects multiple segments, listening 
                    to each and repeating signal on one to every other 
                    connected one; regenerates each transmission 
                    so that it can travel farther.
                
                Repeater or Non-root Access Point    
                    The repeater access point is not connected 
                    to the wired LAN.  The Repeater is a wireless 
                    LAN transceiver that transfers data between 
                    a client and another access point, another 
                    repeater, or between two bridges.  The repeater 
                    is placed within radio range of an access point 
                    connected to the wired LAN, another repeater, or 
                    an non-root bridge to extend the range of the 
                    infrastructure.
                
                Root Access Point    
                    This access point connects clients to the main 
                    wired LAN.
                
                Root Wireless Bridge    
                    This wireless bridge is connected to the main 
                    wired LAN.  This wireless bridge can communicate
                    with non-root wireless bridges, repeater access
                    points, and client devices but not with another 
                    wireless root bridge.  Only one wireless bridge
                    in a wireless LAN can be set as the wireless 
                    root bridge.  

                SSID
                    Radio Service Set ID.  It is used for identification
                    during association.
                
                STA (WSTA)
                    A non-AP 802.11 wireless station.

                TKIP      
                    WPA Temporal Key encryption.

                Unlicensed National Information Infrastucture (UNII)

                    The UNII bands are in the 5 GHz range and are 100
                    MHz wide.  These bands are used by 802.11a-compliant
                    devices. 

                WEP
                    Wired Equivalent Privacy.  'WEP' is generally used
                    to refer to 802.11 encryption.
                
                WPA
                    WiFi Protected Access
