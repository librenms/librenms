    DESCRIPTION
        "A MIB module for extending the POWER-ETHERNET-MIB
        (RFC3621) to add objects which provide additional
        management information about Power Sourcing Equipment
        (PSE) not available in POWER-ETHERNET-MIB.

        Glossary

        Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE)
            These are devices supplying electrical power to
            other equipment. They are, for example, inline power
            switches, inline power daughterboards and power patch
            panels.

        Powered Device (PD)
            These are devices receiving their electrical power
            supply from Power Sourcing Equipment. They are, for
            example, IP telephones and wireless access points
            or bridges."

    DESCRIPTION
        "This object is an extension of the pethPsePortAdminEnable
        object from RFC3621. It allows the user to be more specific
        when enabling the PSE functions. The states, 'auto', 'static'
        and 'limit' correspond to a value of 'true' for the
        pethPsePortAdminEnable object. The state 'disable' corresponds
        to a value of 'false' for the pethPsePortAdminEnable object.

        Setting this value to 'auto' enables Powered Device discovery
        on the interface and the amount of power allocated depends on
        the Powered Device discovered. If pethPsePortAdminEnable was
        'false' prior to this set operation, then it will become
        'true'.

        Setting this value to 'static' will also enable Powered
        Device discovery. However, this is different from 'auto'
        in that the amount of power is pre-allocated based on the
        configuration on the Power Sourcing Equipment. If
        pethPsePortAdminEnable was 'false' prior to this set
        operation, then it will become 'true'.

        Setting this value to 'limit' enables Powered Device
        discovery on the interface. The amount of power allocated
        depends on the Powered Device discovered and the value
        of cpeExtPsePortPwrMax. The lower value will be used.
        If pethPsePortAdminEnable was 'false' prior to this set
        operation, then it will become 'true'.

        Setting this value to 'disable' disables the PSE functions.
        The pethPsePortAdminEnable object will adopt the value of
        'false' if it was 'true' prior to this set operation. When
        setting the pethPsePortAdminEnable object to 'false' this
        object cpeExtPsePortEnable will adopt the value of 'disable'.

        If cpeExtPsePortPolicingCapable of the PSE port, or
        cpeExtMainPsePwrMonitorCapable of the PSE port's
        main group, has the value of 'false', this object
        can only be set to 'auto', 'static' or 'disable'.
        Otherwise, this object can be set to 'auto', 'static',
        'limit' or 'disable'."
