    DESCRIPTION
        "An extension to the IETF BGP4 MIB module defined in
        RFC 1657.

        Following is the terminology associated with Border
        Gateway Protocol(BGP).

        UPDATE message
            UPDATE messages are used to transfer routing 
            information between BGP peers. An UPDATE message 
            is used to advertise a single feasible route to a
            peer, or to withdraw multiple unfeasible routes 
            from service.                 

        Adj-RIBs-In 
           The Adj-RIBs-In store routing information that has
           been learned from inbound UPDATE messages. Their 
           contents represent routes that are available as an 
           input to the Decision Process.

        Loc-RIB(BGP table) 
           The Loc-RIB contains the local routing information
           that the BGP speaker has selected by applying its 
           local policies to the routing information contained 
           in its Adj-RIBs-In.

        Adj-RIBs-Out 
           The Adj-RIBs-Out store the information that the
           local BGP speaker has selected for advertisement to 
           its peers. The routing information stored in the 
           Adj-RIBs-Out will be carried in the local BGP 
           speaker's UPDATE messages and advertised to its
           peers.

        Path Attributes
           A variable length sequence of path attributes is 
           present in every UPDATE. Each path attribute is a 
           triple <attribute type, attribute length, 
           attribute value> of variable length. 

        Network Layer Reachability Information(NLRI)
           A variable length field present in UPDATE messages
           which contains a list of Network Layer address 
           prefixes. 

        Address Family Identifier(AFI) 
           Primary identifier to indicate the type of the 
           Network Layer Reachability Information(NLRI) being 
           carried.

        Subsequent Address Family Identifier(SAFI) 
           Secondary identifier to indicate the type of the 
           Network Layer Reachability Information(NLRI) being 
           carried."

        "One or more path attributes not understood by this

        such attribute(s).  Octets beyond the maximum size, if
        any, are not recorded by this object.  

        Each path attribute is a triple <attribute type,
        attribute length, attribute value> of variable length.
        Attribute Type is a two-octet field that consists of
        the Attribute Flags octet followed by the Attribute
        Type Code octet.  If the Extended Length bit of the 
        Attribute Flags octet is set to 0, the third octet of 
        the Path Attribute contains the length of the
        attribute data in octets.  If the Extended Length bit 
        of the Attribute Flags octet is set to 1, then the
        third and the fourth octets of the path attribute 
        contain the length of the attribute data in octets.
        The remaining octets of the Path Attribute represent 
        the attribute value and are interpreted according to 
        the Attribute Flags and the Attribute Type Code."
