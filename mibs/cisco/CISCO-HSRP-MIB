    DESCRIPTION
        "The MIB module provides a means to monitor and configure
        the Cisco IOS proprietary Hot Standby Router Protocol
        (HSRP). Cisco HSRP protocol is defined in RFC2281.

        Terminology:

        HSRP is a protocol used amoung a group of routers for the
        purpose of selecting an 'active router' and a 'standby
        router'.

        An 'active router' is the router of choice for routing
        packets.

        A 'standby router' is a router that takes over the routing
        duties when an active router fails, or when preset
        conditions have been met.

        An 'HSRP group' or a 'standby group' is a set of routers
        which communicate using HSRP. An HSRP group has a group MAC
        address and a group Virtual IP address. These are the
        designated addresses. The active router assumes (i.e.
        inherits) these group addresses.

        'Hello' messages are sent to indicate that a router is
        running and is capable of becoming the active or standby
        router.

        'Hellotime' is the interval between successive HSRP Hello
        messages from a given router.

        'Holdtime' is the interval between the receipt of a Hello
        message and the presumption that the sending router has
        failed."

    DESCRIPTION
        "Information about an HSRP group. Management applications
        use cHsrpGrpRowStatus to control entry modification,
        creation and deletion.

        Setting cHsrpGrpRowStatus to 'active' causes the router to
        communicate using HSRP.

        The value of cHsrpGrpRowStatus may be set to 'destroy' at
        any time.

        Entries may not be created via SNMP without explicitly 
        setting cHsrpGrpRowStatus to either 'createAndGo' or 
        'createAndWait'.

        Entries can be created and modified via the management 
        protocol or by the device's local management interface.

        A management application wishing to create an entry should
        choose the ifIndex of the interface which is to be added
        as part of an HSRP group. Also, a cHsrpGrpNumber should
        be chosen. A group number is unique only amongst the groups 
        on a particular interface. The value of the group number
        appears in packets which are transmitted and received on a 
        LAN segment to which the router is connected. The application
        must select the group number as explained in the description
        for cHsrpGrpNumber.

        If the row is not active, and a local management interface
        command modifies that row, the row may transition to active
        state.

        A row which is not in active state will timeout after a
        configurable period (five minutes by default). This timeout 
        period can be changed by setting cHsrpConfigTimeout."

        If two (or more) routers in a group have the same priority,
        the one with the highest ip address of the interface is the
        active router. When the active router fails to send a Hello
        message within a configurable period of time, the standby
        router with the highest priority becomes the active
        router.

        A router with highest priority will only attempt to
