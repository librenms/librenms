    DESCRIPTION 
        "The MIB module for IGMP Snooping feature. 

         Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is the protocol used 
         by IPv4 end hosts to indicate their interest in receiving 
         multicast traffic for certain multicast groups to neighboring 
         multicast routers. Version 3 of IGMP adds support for source 
         based filtering; which means the end hosts can specifically 
         indicate to receive or not-receive multicast packets from 
         specific source addresses. This information is used by the 
         multicast routers to restrict forwarding of multicast traffic 
         for the host.

         IGMP Snooping is a switch protocol. A switch that implements 
         IGMP Snooping listens to the IGMP messages exchanged between 
         the hosts and router, then provides selective transmission of 
         multicast traffic based on multicast mac destination address
         or multicast group address.  With IGMPv3 support, 
         IGMP Snooping can potentially provide selective transmission
         of multicast data based on (source address, group address) 
         onto the ports that are interested. In addition to this, 
         IGMP Snooping can also provide proxy reporting, report 
         suppression and fast leave capabilities."
    
    REVISION    "0303240000Z"
    DESCRIPTION
        "Add support for the following:
         - per VLAN IGMP Snooping configuration and group
           membership information
         - per port IGMP Snooping configuration
         - per VLAN IGMP Querier configuration
         - global rate-limit control objects

           configuration related objects."
