    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB is intended to be implemented on all those
        devices operating as Central controllers, that
        terminate the Light Weight Access Point Protocol
        tunnel from Cisco Light-weight LWAPP Access Points.

        This MIB provides the information about the
        operational parameters of the 802.11 networks.
        References about specific type of 802.11 flavors like
        802.11a/b/g or 802.11n will be made whereever required
        to indicate that the respective parameters are
        applicable only to that particular type of 802.11
        networks.

        The relationship between CC and the LWAPP APs
        can be depicted as follows:

        The LWAPP tunnel exists between the controller and
        the APs.  The MNs communicate with the APs through
        the protocol defined by the 802.11 standard.

        LWAPP APs, upon bootup, discover and join one of the
        controllers and the controller pushes the configuration,
        that includes the WLAN parameters, to the LWAPP APs.
        The APs then encapsulate all the 802.11 frames from
        wireless clients inside LWAPP frames and forward
        the LWAPP frames to the controller.

                           GLOSSARY

        Access Point ( AP )

        An entity that contains an 802.11 medium access
        control ( MAC ) and physical layer ( PHY ) interface
        and provides access to the distribution services via
        the wireless medium for associated clients.  

        LWAPP APs encapsulate all the 802.11 frames in
        LWAPP frames and sends them to the controller to which
        it is logically connected.

        Gratuitous Probe Response (GPR)

        The Gratuitous Probe Response feature aids in conserving
        battery power of WLAN-enabled cell phones by providing
        a high rate packet on the order of tens of milliseconds
        such that these kind of phones can wake up and wait at
        predefined intervals, to reduce battery power.  The 
        GPR packet is transmitted from the AP at a predefined
        time interval.


        Light Weight Access Point Protocol ( LWAPP )

        This is a generic protocol that defines the 
        communication between the Access Points and the
        Central Controller. 

        Mobile Node ( MN )

        A roaming 802.11 wireless device in a wireless
        network associated with an access point. Mobile Node 
        and client are used interchangeably. 

        TU

        A measurement of time in units of 1024 microseconds.

        802.11n

        802.11n builds upon previous 802.11 standards by
        adding MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output). 
        MIMO uses multiple transmitter and receiver antennas
        to allow for increased data throughput through spatial
        multiplexing and increased range .

        A-MPDU

        An aggregated format that consists of several MAC
        Protocol Data Units being aggregated and transmitted
        in one PHY Service Data Unit.

        A-MSDU

        An aggregated format that consists of several MAC
        Service Data Units being aggregated and transmitted
        in one MAC Protocol Data Unit.

        Reduced Inter-Frame Space ( RIFS )

        A time interval between multiple transmissions of a
        single transmitter used to reduce overhead and
        increase network efficiency.

        Modulation and Coding Scheme ( MCS )

        This is a value that determines the modulation, coding
        and number of spatial channels.  Each scheme specifies
        the modulation technique, coding rate , number of 
        spatial streams  etc and the corresponding data rate.

        Guard Interval

        Guard intervals are used to ensure that distinct 
        transmissions do not interfere with one another. 
        The purpose of the guard interval is to introduce 
        immunity to propagation delays, echoes and 
        reflections, to which digital data is normally 
        very sensitive.

        Media Access Control ( MAC )

        The Media Access Control Layer is one of two sublayers 
        that make up the Data Link Layer.  The MAC layer is 
        responsible for moving data packets to and from one 
        Network Interface Card (NIC) to another across a shared 
        channel.

        Suppression Table

        When the Band Select feature is ON, AP suppresses 
        the probe response to mobile stations on 2.4 GHz. AP 
        suppresses probe response to new mobile stattions for 
        all SSIDs that are being Band Select enabled. 
        Suppressed mobile station and corresponding suprression 
        counts are recorded in a table known as Suppression 
        Table which is stored in internal database of controller.
        Entries of this table aged-out to make place for new 
        entries.

        Dual Band Table

        When AP sees probe request from any mobile station in 
        both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band AP will know that mobile station
        is capable of operating on both band. Dual band capable
        mobile stations are recorded in a table known as dual band 
        table which is stored in internal database of controller.
        This record are kept to make sure 5GHz capable mobile station
        should join 5GHz band only.
        Entries in the table will be age out to make space for
        new entries. 
        The AP will not respond to the dual band mobile station's
        2.4GHz probe until is removed from the dual band
        table. AP fills the dual band table in the
        following order until it is full:
        1) mobile station with 5GHz probe that have associated to
           2.4GHz.
        2) mobile station with 5GHz probe that also have 2.4GHz
           probes.
        3) mobile station with just 5GHz probe detected and 5GHz
           association.

        RSSI

        Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI), the IEEE 802.11
        standard defines a mechanism by which RF energy is to be 
        measured by the circuitry on a wireless NIC. Its value is 
        measured in dBm and ranges from -128 to 0.
