    DESCRIPTION
        "The MIB module to describe active system processes.
        Virtual Machine refers to those OS which can run the 
        code or process of a different executional model OS.
        Virtual Process assume the executional model 
        of a OS which is different from Native OS. Virtual
        Processes are also referred as Tasks.
        Thread is a sequence of instructions to be executed
        within a program. Thread which adhere to POSIX standard
        is referred as a POSIX thread."

CPULoadAverage ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

    DESCRIPTION
        "The average number of processes in the queue waiting for CPU
        time over the last N minutes, where the N is defined by the 
        object using this TC. This is similar to UNIX/Linux system load
        average. The calculation may vary by different OS kernels, so
        refer  to  the specific system document of your interest.
        The object value, which uses this TC, reflects the average
        number of runnable processes with units of hundredths of
        processes, i.e. a value of 183 indicates the average number of
        runnable processes over the N minutes is 1.83."
