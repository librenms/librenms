    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB is intended to be implemented on all those
        devices operating as Central Controllers (CC) that
        terminate the Light Weight Access Point Protocol
        tunnel from Light-weight LWAPP Access Points.

        This MIB provides configuration and status information
        about the 802.11 WLAN mobility.                 

        The relationship between CC and the LWAPP APs
        can be depicted as follows:

           The LWAPP tunnel exists between the controller and
           the APs.  The MNs communicate with the APs through
           the protocol defined by the 802.11 standard.


           LWAPP APs, upon bootup, discover and join one of the
           controllers and the controller pushes the configuration,
           that includes the WLAN parameters, to the LWAPP APs.

           The APs then encapsulate all the 802.11 frames from
           wireless clients inside LWAPP frames and forward
           the LWAPP frames to the controller.


                              GLOSSARY

           Access Point ( AP )

           An entity that contains an 802.11 medium access
           control ( MAC ) and physical layer ( PHY ) interface
           and provides access to the distribution services via
           the wireless medium for associated clients.  

           LWAPP APs encapsulate all the 802.11 frames in
           LWAPP frames and sends it to the controller to which
           it is logically connected.


           Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID)

           The identifier for the service set comprising of
           all the 802.11 stations under the control of
           one coordinating Access Point.  This identifier
           happens to be the MAC address of the dot11 radio
           interface of the Access Point.  The wireless
           clients that associate with the Access Point
           get the wired uplink through this particular 
           dot11 interface. 


           Central Controller ( CC )

           The central entity that terminates the LWAPP protocol
           tunnel from the LWAPP APs.  Throughout this MIB,
           this entity also referred to as 'controller'. 


           Light Weight Access Point Protocol ( LWAPP ) 

           This is a generic protocol that defines the 
           communication between the Access Points and the
           Central Controller. 


           Mobility Oracle (MO)

           When a Central Controller in the Mobility Group is 
           designated as Mobility Oracle, then all the Mobility 
           Controller's (MC) traffic is tunnelled to it by other
           Mobility Controllers. Currently, MO resides along with MC
           but MC can reside in a box without MO.


           Mobility Controller (MC)

           When a Central Controller in the Mobility Group is 
           designated as Mobility Controller, then all the Mobile 
           Anchor's traffic is tunnelled to it by other Anchors.
           Each MC has its own/self mobility agent (MA), but MA can
           reside in a box without MC.


           Mobility Agent (MA)

           The Mobility Agent is an entity residing on the access 
           switch that manages mobility events on the switch, and 
           communicates with the Mobility Controller. Access Points
           can associate directly with MA.


           Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)

           Wireless LAN Controller are legacy mobility device which 
           can participate in the new mobility architecture.


           Mobility Manager

           The Mobility Manager is the management entity in a mobility
           controller or mobility agent.


           Mobile Node ( MN )

           A roaming 802.11 wireless device in a wireless
           network associated with an access point. 


           Anchor MC, Anchor MA

           Anchor MC or Anchor MA is the mobility entity where a mobile
           client was first anchored or associated. This is equivalent 
           to home agent (HA).


           Associated MC, Associated MA

           Associated MC or Associated MA is the mobility entity where 
           a mobile client roamed and get associated. This is equivalent
           to foreign agent (FA). It can be local or remote.


           Mobility 

           Concept by which a Mobile Node can roam from one 
           Access Point to another Access Point, across multiple
           Central Controllers, without need for repeated 
           authentication. 


           Mobility Group

           A set of Central Controllers which exchange Mobile 
           Node's authentication information, so that the Mobile
           Node upon roaming need not re-authenticate.  


           Switch Peer Group (SPG)

           A set of mobility agents (MAs) form a Switch Peer Group.
           One or more SPGs are associated with one mobility 
           controller (MC). Traffic between mobility agents within
           a SPG group goes directly between them - not through their
           associated MC


           Mobility Anchor

           When a Central Controller in the Mobility Group is 
           designated as Mobility Anchor, then all the Mobile 
           Node's traffic is tunnelled to it by other
           Controllers in the Mobility Group.


           Guest Tunneling (GT)

           The concept of designating a Central Controller in 
           the Mobility Group as Mobility Anchor, so that all
           the Mobile Node's traffic is tunnelled to it by other
           Controllers in the Mobility Group.              


           Station Management (SMT)

           This term refers to the internal management of the
           802.11 protocol operations by the AP to work
           cooperatively with the other APs and 802.11
           devices in the network.


           Ethernet over Internet Protocol (EoIP)

           Ethernet over IP (EoIP) is a protocol that creates 
           an Ethernet tunnel between two routers on top of an
           IP connection. The EoIP interface appears as an 
           Ethernet interface.


           Reverse path filtering (RPF) 

           Reverse path filtering (RPF) is a feature provided
           by most modern Internet Protocol routers, which may
           be used to reduce the risk of customers attacking
           other internet hosts. One of the problems network
           service providers face today is hackers generating
           packets with fake source IP addresses, a technique
           known as spoofing. This is often done in order to
           initiate a denial-of-service attack against another
           internet host or network.
           Since the source IP addresses of the incoming packets
           change, often randomly, and for every packet, the
           target of such an attack can't easily filter out the
           attacking packets. However, the source of the attack,
           i.e. the network service provider of the attacking 
           host, has a simple way to stop such packets from ever
           leaving its network. A router always knows which 
           networks are reachable via any of its interfaces. 

           By checking the source IP address of all packets 
           coming in via an interface against the networks known
           to be behind that interface, the router can simply 
           drop packets that aren't supposed to come from there.

           Hence, reverse path filtering filters packets 
           according to the 'reverse path' to their source 
           IP address. If the path back to the source IP address 
           does not match the path the packet is coming from,
           it is dropped.

        10.16.109.199               10.16.109.199

        In the above diagram, Central Controllers CC1 and CC2 have
        been configured in a Mobility Group.

        Currently the Mobile Node 'MN1' obtains its IP from the
        Central Controller 'CC1' with which it first associates
        via WLAN '1' through Access Point 'AP1'. 'CC1'
        obtains DHCP address, say 10.16.109.199 for client 'MN1'.
        Now the client 'MN1' is identified by 10.16.109.199 for
        further communication with the network and the
        communication happens via 'CC1'.

        Since, 'CC1' and 'CC2' are in same mobility group, 'CC1'
        sends the authentication block of 'MN1' to 'CC2'.


        Central Controller 'CC2' has an associated Access Point
        'AP2' which beams WLAN '1' and uses 10.16.105.0 /
        255.255.255.0 subnet instead.

        Next, the Mobile Node 'MN1' moves out of range of 'AP1'
        and gets in to proximity with 'AP2' and continues to use
        WLAN '1'. 'CC2' locally authenticates 'MN1' against
        authentication block shared from 'CC1'. 'CC2' forwards all
        traffic from 'MN1' to router. This is called WLAN mobility.

        But hold on, 'CC2' uses 10.16.105.0 / 255.255.255.0 subnet
        for WLAN '1'. So we have two problems here :

        a> Traffic of 10.16.109.0 / 255.255.255.0 subnet has to be
        accessible from 10.16.105.0 / 255.255.255.0 subnet.

        b> Unneccessary overloading of 10.16.105.0 / 255.255.255.0
        subnet by traffic from 10.16.109.0 / 255.255.255.0 subnet.

        How do we address these issues ??

        If an EoIP tunnel can be established between 'CC1' and 'CC2'
        and 'CC1' sends all traffic bound to 'MN1', 10.16.109.199,
        on this tunnel to 'CC2', which in turn forwards it to 'MN1',
        then, above two subnet-problems are resolved. This is called
        Mobility Anchoring. 'CC1' is the Mobility Anchor and 'CC2' is
        the 'Foreign' for WLAN '1'.

        As per the configuration, user creates a Mobility Anchor entry
        in 'CC2' for WLAN '1' with IP address as 'CC1', i.e.
        10.16.109.112. So, when 'MN1' connects to WLAN '1' via
        'AP2', then 'CC2' establishes EoIP tunnel with 10.16.109.112
        and forwards the packets to 'MN1'.

        Given the above example, the cLMobilityAnchorEntry on 'CC2'
        looks like :

        ------------------------------------------------------------------
        |      MIB - ATTRIBUTES           |       ROW#1        |  ROW#2  |

        ------------------------------------------------------------------
        | cLMobilityExtAnchorAssociatedMCAddressType |   ipv4    |       |
        ------------------------------------------------------------------
        | cLMobilityExtAnchorAssociatedMCAddress | 10.16.109.112 |       |

        | cLMobilityExtAnchorStatus          |        up(4)    |         |
        ------------------------------------------------------------------
        | cLMobilityExtAnchorRowStatus       |    active(1)    |         |
        ------------------------------------------------------------------

        This feature has advantages for both security and load
        balancing.  It can be used to restrict a WLAN to a single
        subnet, regardless of the MN's entry point into the network.
        A 'public' or guest WLAN can thus be accessed throughout an
        enterprise, but still is restricted to a specific subnet.
        It can also be used to provide some geographic load balancing,
        since the WLANs can represent a particular section of a
        building (ie., engineering, marketing).  Those groups can be
        'anchored' on a particular subnet/switch rather than on the
        CC of first occurrence (ie., the switch controlling the APs
        by the front door)."
