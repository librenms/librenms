    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module defines the managed objects that support
        monitoring of thresholds on interfaces.  Configuration and
        monitoring of the thresholds is done through threshold
        templates that can be assigned to any subset of interfaces on
        the network element.  More than one threshold template can be
        assigned to a given interface.

        This MIB module should be used when it is desired to apply a
        common set of thresholds to a subset of the available
        interfaces.  If a threshold is to be applied to only one
        interface, then the EVENT-MIB or the RMON-MIB may be used as
        simpler alternatives.  If a threshold is to be applied to all
        available interfaces, then the EVENT-MIB may be used as a
        simpler alternative."

    DESCRIPTION
        "The manner in which to compare cifthThresholdObject to
        cifthThresholdFiredValue and cifthThresholdClearedValue.

        The value 'absoluteValue' indicates that the value of
        cifthThresholdObject is to be compared directly to
        cifthThresholdFiredValue or cifthThresholdClearedValue.
        
        The value 'deltaValue' indicates that the difference between
        two successive samples of cifthThresholdObject is to be
        compared to cifthThresholdFiredValue or
        cifthThresholdClearedValue.  The polling interval between
        successive samples is defined in cifthThresholdSampleInterval.
        
        The value 'rateOfIncreaseExponentXIfSpeed' indicates that the
        rate of increase of cifthThresholdObject is to be compared to
        the negated value of cifthThresholdFiredValue used as the
        exponent of 10, times the value of ifSpeed (if the value of
        ifSpeed is less than the maximum value) or ifHighSpeed
        (otherwise).  For example, a value of cifthThresholdFiredValue
        of 5 on a gigabit ethernet interface indicates a threshold of
        10^-5 times the interface speed, which is equal to 10,000 per
        second.  When the value of this object is
        'rateOfIncreaseExponentXIfSpeed', the polling interval between
        successive samples is determined automatically by the agent.

        When the object identified by cifthThresholdObject is a
        counter, a threshold type of 'deltaValue' or
        'rateOfIncreaseExponentXIfSpeed' should be used.  When the
        object identified by cifthThresholdObject is not a counter, a
        threshold type of 'absoluteValue' should be used."

        When the value of this object is 'up', this indicates that
        the thresholds in this template (identified by
        cifthTemplateIndex) are activated on this interface, with the
        following exception:  If a threshold is defined on an object

        One reason for a template not to be operational on an

        (or more) templates assigned to it that contain thresholds on
        the same object with the same severity and direction, i.e.,
        thresholds with the same values of cifthThresholdObject,
        cifthThresholdSeverity, and cifthThresholdDirection.  This may
        occur when a template is assigned to the interface, or when a
        threshold is added to a template that is already active on the
        interface.  When this occurs, the implementation may operate on
        both (or all) threshold values, or it may take down one (or
        more) of the templates on this interface, which is indicated by
        changing the value of this object from 'up' to 'down'."
