    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB is intended to be implemented on all those
        devices operating as Central Controllers (CC)  that
        terminate the Light Weight Access Point Protocol
        tunnel from Cisco Light-weight LWAPP Access Points.

        This MIB helps to manage the WLANs on the controller.

        The relationship between CC and the LWAPP APs
        can be depicted as follows:

        The LWAPP tunnel exists between the controller and
        the APs.  The MNs communicate with the APs through
        the protocol defined by the 802.11 standard.

        LWAPP APs, upon bootup, discover and join one of the
        controllers and the controller pushes the configuration,
        that includes the WLAN parameters, to the LWAPP APs.
        The APs then encapsulate all the 802.11 frames from
        wireless clients inside LWAPP frames and forward
        the LWAPP frames to the controller.

                           GLOSSARY

        Access Point ( AP )

        An entity that contains an 802.11 medium access
        control ( MAC ) and physical layer ( PHY ) interface
        and provides access to the distribution services via
        the wireless medium for associated clients.  

        LWAPP APs encapsulate all the 802.11 frames in
        LWAPP frames and sends it to the controller to which
        it is logically connected to.

        Central Controller ( CC )

        The central entity that terminates the LWAPP protocol
        tunnel from the LWAPP APs.  Throughout this MIB,
        this entity also referred to as 'controller'.

        Light Weight Access Point Protocol ( LWAPP ) 

        This is a generic protocol that defines the
        communication between the Access Points and the
        controllers.

        Mobile Node ( MN )

        A roaming 802.11 wireless device in a wireless
        network associated with an access point. 

        Access Control List ( ACL )

        A list of rules used to restrict the traffic reaching 
        an interface or the CPU or WLAN.  Each ACL is an ordered
        set of rules and actions.  If a rule matches then the 
        action for that rule is applied to the packet.

        802.1x

        The IEEE ratified standard for enforcing port based
        access control.  This was originally intended for
        use on wired LANs and later extended for use in
        802.11 WLAN environments.  This defines an
        architecture with three main parts - a supplicant
        (Ex. an 802.11 wireless client), an authenticator
        (the AP) and an authentication server(a Radius
        server).  The authenticator passes messages back
        and forth between the supplicant and the
        authentication server to enable the supplicant
        get authenticated to the network.

        Temporal Key Integrity Protocol ( TKIP )

        A security protocol defined to enhance the limitations
        of WEP.  Message Integrity Check and per-packet keying
        on all WEP-encrypted frames are two significant
        enhancements provided by TKIP to WEP.

        Cisco Key Integrity Protocol ( CKIP )

        A proprietary implementation similar to TKIP.  CKIP
        implements key permutation for protecting the CKIP
        key against attacks.  Other features of CKIP include
        expansion of encryption key to 16 bytes of length for
        key protection and MIC to ensure data integrity.

        Wired Equivalent Privacy ( WEP )

        A security method defined by 802.11. WEP uses a
        symmetric key stream cipher called RC4 to encrypt the
        data packets.

        Wi-Fi Protected Access ( WPA )

        Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) are security
        systems created in response to several serious
        weaknesses found in Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP).
        WPA implements the majority of the IEEE 802.11i
        standard, and was intended as an intermediate
        measure to take the place of WEP while 802.11i was
        prepared. WPA is designed to work with all wireless
        network interface cards, but not necessarily with
        first generation wireless access points.

        WLAN Layer 2 Security

        WLAN layer 2 (MAC) security defines the encryption and 
        authentication approaches such as 802.1x, WPA, 
        WPA2, CKIP and WEP.                

        Delivery Traffic Indication Map ( DTIM )

        DTIM is measured in beacon intervals and is the time 
        period during which multicast/broadcast packets are
        sent to clients. This helps client to go in Power Saving
        mode and helps to save battery power.

        Network Admission Control (NAC)

        Cisco NAC uses the network infrastructure to enforce security
        policy compliance on all devices that seek to access network
        computing resources. With the Cisco NAC appliance, network
        administrators can authenticate, authorize, evaluate, and
        remediate wired, wireless, and remote users and their machines
        prior to network access. The Cisco NAC appliance identifies
        whether networked devices such as laptops, IP phones, or game
        consoles are compliant with network security policies, and
        repairs any vulnerabilities before it permits access to the
        network.

        Out of Band (OOB)

        Out-of-band deployments require user traffic to traverse through
        the NAC appliance only within authentication, posture
        assessment, and remediation. When a user is authenticated and
        passes all policy checks, the traffic is switched normally
        through the network and bypasses the NAC server.

        Band Select

        The 2.4 GHz band is congested and clients have to contend with
        numerous performance challenges. These consist of interference
        from Bluetooth, microwave ovens, cordless phones, etc.;
        protection mechanisms from 802.11b legacy clients; and
        co-channel interference from other access points due to
        802.11bg?s limit of three non-overlapping channels. Allowing
        client Wi-Fi radios capable of dual band (2.4 and 5 GHz)
        operation move to the less congested 5 GHz radios would improve
        the overall performance of the network.
        The Band Select algorithm is based on probe response suppression
        on clients 2.4G radio. The feature is OFF by default and has to
        be manually switched ON globally for a WLC. It can be optionally
        over-ridden per-SSID to disallow it.

        Network Access Identifier ( NAI )

        In order to provide roaming services, it is necessary 
        to have a standardized method for  identifying users. 
        NAI is actually the user identity submitted by the client 
        during network authentication.

        KTS (Key Telephone System)

        Key Telephone System is an alternative to a 
        private branch exchange (PBX)phone system. 
        A KTS is equipped with several buttons that allow 
        a caller to directly select outgoing lines or 
        incoming calls, and use intercom and
        conference facilities.

        HALO (Hyperlocation)

        Hyperlocation is a technique of calculating location using 
        Angle of Arrival(AoA) tracks 802.11 OFDM clients 
        (meaning 802.11a/g/n/ac clients) that are associated(connected) 
        on the network and is able to do so with much higher accuracy 
        than conventional Real Time Location Systems(RTLS) that rely 
        on only RSSI (RF Signal Strength).

        PakRSSI (Packet Received Signal Strength Indicator)

        PakRSSI is a measurement of the power present in a received radio signal.

        POE (Power Over Ethernet)

        Power over Ethernet or PoE describes any of several standardized 
        or ad-hoc systems which pass electrical power along with data on 
        Ethernet cabling. This allows a single cable to provide both data 
        connection and electrical power to devices such as wireless
        access points or IP cameras.

        Multicast Domain Name System (mDNS)

        This is the underlying protocol that is used for Service 
        advertisement and discovery in technologies like Bonjour, 
        Zero Touch Configuration

        a common index structure for use in several other

        related attributes like authentication, encryption,
        802.11 parameters, Quality-of-Service attributes
