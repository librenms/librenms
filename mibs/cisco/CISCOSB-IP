            to a specified address, e.g., by user configuration.

            dhcp(4) indicates an address that was assigned to this
            system by a DHCP server.

            linklayer(5) indicates an address created by IPv6 stateless
            auto-configuration.

            random(6) indicates an address chosen by the system at
            random, e.g., an IPv4 address within 169.254/16, or an RFC
            3041 privacy address.

            following are additional to standard MIB:

            autoConfig(7) indicates that the address was auto configured configured
            to a specified address, e.g., not by user configuration.

            eui64(8) indicates that the address was partially configured configured
            to a specified address, e.g., address suffix is based on MAC address with
            EUI-64 representation.

            tunnelIsatap(9) indicates that the address an ISATATP tunnel representation.

            tunnelIsatap(10) indicates that the address an 6to4 tunnel representation.

            tunnelIsatap(11) indicates that the address was partially configured configured
            to a specified address, e.g., address prefix is preconfigured.
