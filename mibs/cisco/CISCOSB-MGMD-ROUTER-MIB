            "The value of Robustness in use on this interface.

            The Robustness Variable allows tuning for the expected
            packet loss on a subnet.  If a subnet is expected to be
            lossy, the Robustness Variable may be increased.  IGMP and
            MLD is robust to (Robustness Variable-1) packet losses.

            For IGMPv3/MLDv2, this may differ from the value

rlmgmdRouterInterfaceQrLastMembQueryIntvl OBJECT-TYPE

    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
            "The value of Last Member Query Interval in use on this
            interface.

            The Last Member Query Interval is the Max Response Time
            inserted into Group-Specific and Group-and-Source-specific
            Queries sent in response to Leave messages, and is also
            the amount of time between successive Specific Query
            messages.  This value may be tuned to modify the leave
            latency of the network.  A reduced value results in
            reduced time to detect the loss of the last member of a
            group.

            The value of this object is irrelevant if
            mgmdRouterInterfaceVersion is 1.

            The value of this object is also irrelevant if this
            interface is configured to use immediate-leave behavior
            without a last member query - that is, if
            mgmdRouterInterfaceImmedtLeave is 'true' and
            mgmdRouterInterfaceQryBefImmdLv is 'false'.

            For IGMPv3/MLDv2, this may differ from the value
            configured using mgmdRouterInterfaceLastMembQueryIntvl if
            the local router is not the querier on this interface."
