    DESCRIPTION
        "Represents the different types of memory pools that
        may be present in a managed device.  Memory pools can
        be roughly categorized into two groups, predefined
        pools and dynamic pools.  The following pool types
        are currently predefined:
            1:  processor memory
            2:  i/o memory
            3:  pci memory
            4:  fast memory
            5:  multibus memory

        Dynamic pools will have a pool type value greater than
        any of the predefined types listed above.

        Note that only the processor pool is required to be
        supported by all devices.  Support for other pool types
        is dependent on the device being managed."
