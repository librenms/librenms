	          DSFlowDataSources of this traditional form are called
	          'port-based'. Ideally the sampling entity will perform 
	          sampling on all flows originating from or destined to 
	          the specified interface. However, if the switch architecture 
	          only allows input or output sampling then the sampling agent 
	          is permitted to only sample input flows input or output flows. 
	          Each packet must only be considered once for sampling, 
	          irrespective of the number of ports it will be forwarded to.
	         	
	          Note: Since each DSFlowDataSource operates independently a 
	                packet that crosses multiple DataSources may generate 
	                multiple flow records."

	          "Identify the sFlow receiver associated with this resource.
	
	           A value of zero indicates that this resource is available.
	           If non-zero the value must correspond to a valid, active 
	           dSFlowRcvrIndex.
	
	           If the value is currently zero it may be set to any
	           active entry in the dSFlowRcvrTable. If the value is
	           not zero then a set to anything other than zero or
	           its current value will result in an SNMP error (bad value).
	
	           Setting to zero frees the resource and returns all the
	           values in this entry to their default values.
	
	           If an entry in the dSFlowRcvrTable expires, either
	           because the dSFlowRcvrOwner is set to the empty
	           string or because the dSFlowRcvrCurrentTimeout reaches zero, then
	           the agent must mark all associated resources as available
	           (by setting the associated DSFlowReceiver entry to zero)
	           and all values in these records must be restored to their
	           default values.
	
	           This mechanism provides no enforcement and relies on the
	           cooperation of management entities in order to ensure that
	           competition for a resource is fairly resolved. A management
	           entity should not make any changes to a resource
	           without first acquiring it by successfully writing its
	           dSFlowRcvrIndex value as the DSFlowReceiver for the resource."

	        into the sampling so that exactly every Nth packet is not
	        counted. A sampling rate of 1 counts all packets. A sampling
	        rate of 0 disables sampling.
	           
	        The agent is permitted to have minimum and maximum allowable
	        values for the sampling rate. A minimum rate lets the agent
	        designer set an upper bound on the overhead associated with
	        sampling, and a maximum rate may be the result of hardware
	        restrictions (such as counter size). In addition not all values
	        between the maximum and minimum may be realizable as the 
	        sampling rate (again because of implementation considerations).
	
	        When the sampling rate is set the agent is free to adjust the
	        value so that it lies between the maximum and minimum values
	        and has the closest achievable value.
	
	        When read, the configured sampling rate will be returned."
