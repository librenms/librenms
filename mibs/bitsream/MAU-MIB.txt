                    A value that uniquely identifies the set of                                     
                    possible IEEE 802.3 types that the MAU could be.                                
                    The value is a sum which initially takes the                                    
                    value zero.  Then, for each type capability of

                    added to the sum. For example, a MAU which has                                  
                    the capability to be only 10BASE-T would have a                                 
                    value of 512 (2**9).  In contrast, a MAU which                                  
                    supports both 10Base-T (full duplex) and                                        
                    100BASE-TX (full duplex) would have a value of                                  
                    ((2**11) + (2**16)) or 67584.
