           "Definition of Type-of-Service (tos). The TOS facility is            
            one of the features of the Type of Service octet in the             
            IP datagram header.  The Type of Service octet consists             
            of three fields:

              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+                 
              :                 :                       :     :                 
              :   PRECEDENCE    :          TOS          : MBZ :                 
              :                 :                       :     :                 
              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+                 
                                                                                
            The first field, labeled 'PRECEDENCE' above, is intended            
            to denote the importance or priority of the datagram.               
            The second field, labeled 'TOS' above, denotes how the              
            network should make tradeoffs between throughput, delay,            
            reliability, and cost.                                              
                                                                                
            The last field, labeled 'MBZ' (for 'must be zero') above,           
            is currently unused.  The originator of a datagram sets             
            this field zero (unless participating in an Internet                
            protocol experiment which makes use of that bit).  Routers          
            and recipients of datagrams ignore the value of this field.         
            This field is copied fragmentation.                                 
                                                                                
            In the past there has been some confusion about the size            
            of the TOS field.  RFC-791 defined it as a three bit field,         
            including bits 3-5 in the figure above.  It included bit 6          
            in the MBZ field.  RFC-1122 added bits 6 and 7 to the TOS           
            field, eliminating the MBZ field.  RFC-1349 further                 
            redefined the TOS field to be the four bits shown in the            
            figure above.

             adapter.  For OSA-1 and OSA-2, there is only 1 LAN driver.         
             For OSA-2 ATM, you can have up to 2 LAN driver.                    
             The first driver if configured is for SNA and the second           
             driver is for ATM LAN. FlashLevel consists of two 16

            If the Ti timer times out, a supervisory poll frame is

            VIPARANGE configuration and a subsequent SIOCSVIPA IOCTL

            DVIPA can be moved to another stack as soon as the other            
            stack requests ownership of the DVIPA by creating the               
            same  DVIPA via a subsequent BIND or SIOCSVIPA IOCTL.               
            Any existing connections on this stack will be maintained           
            by the new owning stack until the connections are closed.           
            All new connection requests will be directed to the new             
            stack.  A value of disruptive(5) means that one of two              
            different behaviors will occur:                                     
              - In the case of a subsequent BIND by an application on           
                another stack, no movement of the DVIPA will occur              
                the second application will presumably be disrupted             
                because the BIND fails. (The first application is               
                unaware that another BIND occurred.)                            
              - In the case of a subsequent SIOCSVIPA IOCTL, the DVIPA          
                will move to another stack but connections to the DVIPA         
                on this stack will be broken."

           "The manner in which a dynamic VIPA IP address defined               
            by a VIPARANGE statement, should be moved to another                
            stack.  A value of nonDisruptive(1) means that this                 
            DVIPA can be moved to another stack as soon as the other            
            stack requests ownership of the DVIPA by creating the               
            same DVIPA via a subsequent BIND or SIOCSVIPA IOCTL.                
            Any existing connections on this stack will be maintained           
            by the new owning stack until the connections are closed.           
            All new connection requests will be directed to the new             
            stack.  A value of disruptive(2) means that one of two              
            different behaviors will occur:                                     
              - In the case of a subsequent BIND by an application on           
                another stack, no movement of the DVIPA will occur              
                the second application will presumably be disrupted             
                because the BIND fails. (The first application is               
                unaware that another BIND occurred.)                            
              - In the case of a subsequent SIOCSVIPA IOCTL, the DVIPA          
                will move to another stack but connections to the DVIPA         
                on this stack will be broken."
