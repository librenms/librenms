    DESCRIPTION
        "This enterprise MIB supplements the standard Remote Access
         Dialin User Service (RADIUS) MIBs, namely:
             RADIUS-AUTH-CLIENT-MIB (RFC 2618)
             RADIUS-ACC-CLIENT-MIB  (RFC 2620)

         This module defines additional objects and notifications for
         managing the RADIUS authentication and accounting servers
         in use by the enterprise system.

         All mib objects defined in this module are viewed within the
         context identified in the SNMP protocol (i.e. the community
         string in v1/v2c or the contextName in v3)."

    DESCRIPTION
        "The current state of a RADIUS server. When a server is
         initially configured its state is 'unknown'. When requests
         are sent to this server it will transition to either 'up' or
         'down', depending on whether the server replies to the
         requests. It will then transition between 'up' and 'down'
         accordingly. It will never transition back to 'unknown'."

    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
        "When a RADIUS transitions to a new state, this identifies the
         reason for the transition.

         Note that there are two types of timeouts: packet-level and
         server-level. The packet-level timeout is managed via
         eriRouterRadiusAuthPktTimeout and eriRouterRadiusAcctPktTimeout. The
         server-level timeout is managed via eriRouterRadiusAuthSrvTimeout
         and eriRouterRadiusAcctSrvTimeout.

         All requests will timeout if no response is received within
         the packet-level timeout window. If there is no configured
         server-level timeout the server will be transitioned to 'down'
         immediately. Otherwise the server will transition to 'down'
         only if no replies have been received from the server within
         the server-level timeout window."
