			DESCRIPTION
				"Indicates the status of the software upgrade process
				for this load module.
				active(1)
				   the load module is active and running on the PIU.

				upgradeStarted(2)
				   a load module will have this status directly
				   after the SRDF info for this module is loaded
				   and the xfSwLmUpgradeAdminStatus of the
				   release was set to upgradeStarted.

				upgradeFinished(3)
				   indicates that this load modules has been retreived
				   and burned into the flash memories.This is the
				   state of load modules that are part of an active
				   release.

				upgradeTested(4)
				  This release is running as test and not committed
				  yet.

				upgradeFailed(5)
				   upgraded has failed for a reason, e.g. file transfer
				   checksum was wrong, see xfSwLmUpgradeFailure.

				upgradeAborted(6)
				   when the manager has aborted the upgrade of the
				   complete release whilst this load module wasn't
				   upgradedFinished yet this will be its status.



				The 50 series errors are reported by the FTP client on
				the node.


				errorInternalError(50)
				   An internal error detected before FTP operation.

				errorFileStorage(51)
				   Error when erasing flash to store the downloaded
				   file at the node.

				ftpPingFailed(52)
				   FTP ping failed.

				ftpNoAccess(53)
				   Not able to send the FTP commands.

				ftpConnectionDetailsMissing(54)
				   FTP connection details are missing.

				ftpConnectionDetailsInvalid(55)
				   FTP connection details are invalid.

				ftpConnectionTimeout(56)
				   FTP connection timeout is detected.

				ftpNoSuchRemoteFile(57)
				   No such remote file exists.

				ftpNoSuchRemoteDir(58)
				   No such remote directory exists.


				The 400 series errors occur when the command was not accepted
				and the requested action did not take place, but the error
				condition is temporary and the action may be requested again.


				ftpServiceNotAvailable(421)
				   Service not available, closing control connection. This
				   may be a reply to any command if the service knows it
				   must shut down. Possible causes are transfer timeouts
				   and/or FTP server resets.

				ftpUnableToOpenDataConnection(425)
				  Can't open data connection. Try changing from PASV to
				  PORT mode.

				ftpConnectionClosed(426)
				  Connection closed and file transfer is aborted. Possible
				  causes are out of local diskspace and loss of connection.


				ftpFileBusy(450)
				  Requested file action not taken. File
				  unavailable (e.g file busy).

				ftpLocalError(451)
				  Requested action aborted due to local error in processing.

				ftpInsufficienStorageSpace(452)
				  Requested action not taken due to insufficient
				  storage space on the server.


				The 500 series errors occur when the command was not accepted
				and the requested action did not take place.


				ftpSyntaxError(501)
				  FTP Syntax error in parameters or arguments.

				ftpCommandNotImplemented(502)
				  FTP Command not implemented.

				ftpBadSequenceCommands(503)
				  Bad sequence of the FTP commands.

				ftpParameterNotImplemented(504)
				  FTP command not implemented for that parameter.

				ftpNotLoggedIn(530)
				  Not logged in. Your username and/or password is being
				  rejected, contact the server adminstrator.

				ftpNeedAccount(532)
				  Need account for storing files.

				ftpFileUnavailable(550)
				  Requested action not taken. File unavailable
				  (e.g.file not found, no access). Contact the server
				  adminstrator.

				ftpExceededStorageAllocation(552)
				  Requested file action aborted.Exceeded storage allocation (for
				  current directory or data set). Contact the server adminstrator.

				ftpFileNameNotAllowed(553)
				  Requested action not taken. File name not allowed. Try changing
				  the file name or getting rid of spaces in the file name.
