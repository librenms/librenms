mSTPortPerMstPriority OBJECT-TYPE
SYNTAX INTEGER (0..255)
MAX-ACCESS read-write
STATUS current
DESCRIPTION
"The value of the priority field which is
contained in the first (in network byte order)
octet of the (2 octet long) Port ID. The other
octet of the Port ID is given by the value of
mSTPort."
REFERENCE
"IEEE 802.1D-1990: Section 4.5.5.1"

mSTPortPerMstState OBJECT-TYPE
SYNTAX INTEGER {
disabled(1),
blocking(2),
listening(3),
learning(4),
forwarding(5),
broken(6)
}
MAX-ACCESS read-only
STATUS current
DESCRIPTION
"The port's current state as defined by
application of the Spanning Tree Protocol. This
state controls what action a port takes on
reception of a frame. If the bridge has detected
a port that is malfunctioning it will place that
port into the broken(6) state. For ports that
are disabled (see mSTPortEnable), this object
will have a value of disabled(1)."

mSTPortPerMstPathCost OBJECT-TYPE
SYNTAX INTEGER (1..200000000)
MAX-ACCESS read-write

DESCRIPTION
"The contribution of this port to the path cost of
paths toward the spanning tree root that include
this port. 802.1D-1990 recommends that the
default value of this parameter be in inverse
proportion to the speed of the attached LAN."
