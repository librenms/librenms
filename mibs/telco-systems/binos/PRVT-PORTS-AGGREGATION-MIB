DESCRIPTION
"The total number of events in which packets

aggregatorL2Octets OBJECT-TYPE
SYNTAX Counter32
MAX-ACCESS read-only
STATUS current
DESCRIPTION
"The total number of octets of data (including
those in bad packets) received on the
network (excluding framing bits but including
FCS octets).

This object can be used as a reasonable estimate of
Ethernet utilization. If greater precision is
desired, the etherStatsPkts and etherStatsOctets
objects should be sampled before and after a common
interval. The differences in the sampled values are
Pkts and Octets, respectively, and the number of
seconds in the interval is Interval. These values
are used to calculate the Utilization as follows:

Pkts * (9.6 + 6.4) + (Octets * .8)
Utilization = 
Interval * 10,000

The result of this equation is the Ethernet segment utilization 
which is the percent utilization of the ethernet
segment on a 0 to 100 percent scale."

had a length (excluding framing bits, but
including FCS octets) of between 64 and 1518
octets, inclusive, but had either a bad
Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral
number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with
a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error)."

aggregatorL2Fragments OBJECT-TYPE
SYNTAX Counter32
MAX-ACCESS read-only
STATUS current
DESCRIPTION
"The total number of packets received that were less
than 64 octets in length (excluding framing bits but
including FCS octets) and had either a bad Frame
Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of
octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral
number of octets (Alignment Error).

Note that it is entirely normal for
etherStatsFragments to increment. This is because
it counts both runts (which are normal occurrences
due to collisions) and noise hits."
::= { portsAggregationEntry 15 }

aggregatorL2Jabbers OBJECT-TYPE
SYNTAX Counter32
MAX-ACCESS read-only
STATUS current
DESCRIPTION
"The total number of packets received that were
longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits,
but including FCS octets), and had either a bad
Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number
of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a
non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error).

Note that this definition of jabber is different
from the definition in IEEE-802.3 section 8.2.1.5
(10BASE5) and section 10.3.1.4 (10BASE2). These
documents define jabber as the condition in which any
packet exceeds 20 ms. The allowed range to detect
jabber is between 20 ms and 150 ms."
::= { portsAggregationEntry 16 }

aggregatorL2Collisions OBJECT-TYPE
SYNTAX Counter32
MAX-ACCESS read-only
STATUS current
DESCRIPTION
"The best estimate of the total number of collisions
on this Ethernet segment.

The value returned will depend on the RMON probe's location. 
Sections 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of 
IEEE standard 802.3 states that a station must detect a collision in
the receive mode if three or more stations are
transmitting simultaneously. A repeater port must
detect a collision when two or more stations are
transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on
a repeater port could record more collisions than a
probe connected to a station on the same segment
would.

Probe location plays a much smaller role when
considering 10BASE-T. Section 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE
standard 802.3 defines a collision as the
simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD
circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same
time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect
collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes
placed on a station and a repeater, should report
the same number of collisions.

Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater
should ideally report collisions between the
repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit
collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver
collisions observed on any coaxial segments to which
the repeater is connected."
