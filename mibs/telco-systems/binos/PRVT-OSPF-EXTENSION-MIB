    DESCRIPTION
        "The type of metric, with which the external routes are advertised into the OSPF 
        routing domain. OSPF supports two types of external metrics.  Type 1 external 
        metrics are expressed in the same units as the OSPF interface cost (i.e., in terms 
        of the link state metric).  Type 2 external metrics are an order of magnitude larger; 
        any Type 2 metric is considered greater than the cost of any path internal to the AS.  
        Use of Type 2 external metrics assumes that routing between AS'es is the major 
        cost of routing a packet, and eliminates the need for conversion of external costs 
        to internal link state metrics."
