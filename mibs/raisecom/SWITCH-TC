        	"Each octet within this value specifies a set of eight
        	ports, with the first octet specifying ports 1 through
        	8, the second octet specifying ports 9 through 16, etc.
        	Within each octet, the most significant bit represents
        	the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit
        	represents the highest numbered port.  Thus, each port
        	of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the
        	value of this object.  If that bit has a value of '1'
        	then that port is included in the set of ports; the port
