    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
            "This TC describes the source of a chassis identifier.

            The enumeration 'chassisComponent(1)' represents a chassis
            identifier based on the value of entPhysicalAlias object
            (defined in IETF RFC 6933) for a chassis component (i.e.,
            an entPhysicalClass value of 'chassis(3)').

            The enumeration 'interfaceAlias(2)' represents a chassis
            identifier based on the value of ifAlias object (defined in
            IETF RFC 2863) for an interface on the containing chassis.

            The enumeration 'portComponent(3)' represents a chassis
            identifier based on the value of entPhysicalAlias object
            (defined in IETF RFC 6933) for a port or backplane
            component (i.e., entPhysicalClass value of 'port(10)' or
            'backplane(4)'), within the containing chassis.

            The enumeration 'macAddress(4)' represents a chassis
            identifier based on the value of a unicast source address
            (encoded in network byte order and IEEE 802.3 canonical bit
            order), of a port on the containing chassis as defined in
            IEEE Std 802.

            The enumeration 'networkAddress(5)' represents a chassis
            identifier based on a network address, associated with
            a particular chassis. The encoded address is actually
            composed of two fields. The first field is a single octet,
            representing the IANA AddressFamilyNumbers value for the
            specific address type, and the second field is the network
            address value.

            The enumeration 'interfaceName(6)' represents a chassis
            identifier based on the value of ifName object (defined in
            IETF RFC 2863) for an interface on the containing chassis.

            The enumeration 'local(7)' represents a chassis identifier
            based on a locally defined value."

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
            "This TC describes the format of a chassis identifier string.
            Objects of this type are always used with an associated
            LldpChassisIdSubtype object, which identifies the format of
            the particular LldpChassisId object instance.

            If the associated LldpChassisIdSubtype object has a value of
            'chassisComponent(1)', then the octet string identifies
            a particular instance of the entPhysicalAlias object
            (defined in IETF RFC 6933) for a chassis component (i.e.,
            an entPhysicalClass value of 'chassis(3)').

            If the associated LldpChassisIdSubtype object has a value
            of 'interfaceAlias(2)', then the octet string identifies
            a particular instance of the ifAlias object (defined in
            IETF RFC 2863) for an interface on the containing chassis.
            If the particular ifAlias object does not contain any values,
            another chassis identifier type should be used.

            If the associated LldpChassisIdSubtype object has a value
            of 'portComponent(3)', then the octet string identifies a
            particular instance of the entPhysicalAlias object (defined
            in IETF RFC 6933) for a port or backplane component within
            the containing chassis.

            If the associated LldpChassisIdSubtype object has a value of
            'macAddress(4)', then this string identifies a particular
            unicast source address (encoded in network byte order and
            IEEE 802.3 canonical bit order), of a port on the containing
            chassis as defined in IEEE Std 802.

            If the associated LldpChassisIdSubtype object has a value of
            'networkAddress(5)', then this string identifies a particular
            network address, encoded in network byte order, associated
            with one or more ports on the containing chassis. The first
            octet contains the IANA Address Family Numbers enumeration
            value for the specific address type, and octets 2 through
            N contain the network address value in network byte order.

            If the associated LldpChassisIdSubtype object has a value
            of 'interfaceName(6)', then the octet string identifies
            a particular instance of the ifName object (defined in
            IETF RFC 2863) for an interface on the containing chassis.
            If the particular ifName object does not contain any values,
            another chassis identifier type should be used.

            If the associated LldpChassisIdSubtype object has a value of
            'local(7)', then this string identifies a locally assigned
            Chassis ID."
