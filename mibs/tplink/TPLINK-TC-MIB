		DESCRIPTION
			"The status column has three defined values:
			- `active(1)', which indicates that the conceptual row is
			  available for using by the managed device;
			
			- `createAndGo(4)', which is supplied by a management
			  station wishing to create a new instance of a
			  conceptual row and to have its status automatically set
			  to active, making it available for using by the managed
			  device;
		   
			- `destroy(6)', which is supplied by a management station
			  wishing to delete all of the instances associated with
			  an existing conceptual row."

		DISPLAY-HINT "1x-1x-1x-1x-1x-1x"
		STATUS       current
		DESCRIPTION
				"Represents an 802 MAC address represented in the
				`canonical' order defined by IEEE 802.1a, i.e., as if it
				were transmitted least significant bit first, even though
				802.5 (in contrast to other 802.x protocols) requires MAC
				addresses to be transmitted most significant bit first."
