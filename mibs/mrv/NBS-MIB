    DESCRIPTION
      "Textual conventions for NBS mibs.

       Some informal NBS conventions used include the following:

         A DESCRIPTION specifying 'Persistent' indicates a user-
         configured attribute that can be stored in the Agent's
         non-volatile file system as a configuration file such as
         'startup-config'.

         A DESCRIPTION specifying 'Impulse' indicates a user setting
         that the Agent will immediately attempt but will not store
         persistently.

         An object name containing 'Admin' indicates a setting
         requested by the user which may be overridden by the system.
         Admin objects should be updated in the Agent immediately, so
         a GET request immediately after the SET is accepted will
         be answered with a GET-RESPONSE indicating the new value.

         An object name containing 'Oper' indicates an attribute's
         actual state.

         An object name containing 'Caps' is a bitmask which refers to
         the capabilities of an entity to support corresponding entries
         in a specified feature table."
