	    DESCRIPTION
		"The layer 2 encapsulation of the link. The use of
                ppp(1) as described in RFC 1661 is the preferred 
                encapsulation for point-to-point links. The encapsulation 
                is set to x25(2) for X.25-only links and to x25-ppp(3) for 
                concurrent use of X.25 and PPP.

		Mpr-lapb(7) and mpr-hdlc(8) are popular proprietary
		encapsulations. They both use the ethertype number
		for protocol multiplexing. The former is used when
		error correction or data compression (v42bis) is desired.
		The latter (mpr-hdlc) is compatible to Cisco's HDLC
		encapsulation.

		On IP-only links it is also possible to use the
		ISO LAPB protocol (ip-lapb(4)), also known as X.75,
		or raw hdlc framing (ip-hdlc(6)).

                The x75-ppp encapsulation provides PPP over X.75 (LAPB)
		framing,  x75btx-ppp provides PPP over T.70 and LAPB framing
		including a BTX protocol header.

		The x25-nosig(13) encapsulation is used to establish X.25
		connections over dialup links without specific signalling
		on the D-channel (pure data call).

                The x25-ppp-opt encapsulation provides a special kind of the
                x25-ppp encapsulation. Dialin partner will be authenticated
                either outband to establish an X.25 connection via ISDN or
                optional inband by using the point-to-point protocol (PPP).
                Concurrent use of X.25 and PPP encapsulation is excluded.

		The x25-noconfig(16) and x25-noconfig-nosig(17) encapsulations
		provide a solution for establishing X.25 connections via ISDN.
		The dial number will be derived from X.25 destination address
		by using special rules. 

		V42bis data compression can be enabled on LAPB links only, 
		because v42bis requires an error free connection.

		The v120-ppp(19) enables a GSM HSCSD connect. Data Rates up 
		to 57KBps are possible.

		Dialup links can be removed by setting this field
                to delete(5). This has no effect on permanent links."

		Another way to authenticate dial-in users is by using

		Users can authenticate themselves either using PAP, CHAP or
