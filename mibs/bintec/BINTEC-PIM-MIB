            group prefixes to the PIM mode and RP address to use for
            groups within that group prefix.

            Rows in this table are created for a variety of reasons,
            indicated by the value of the pimGroupMappingOrigin object.

            -  Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'fixed' are
               created automatically by the router at startup, to
               correspond to the well-defined prefixes of link-local and
               unroutable group addresses.  These rows are never
               destroyed.

            -  Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'embedded' are
               created by the router to correspond to group prefixes
               that are to be treated as being in Embedded-RP format.

            -  Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'configRp' are
               created and destroyed as a result of rows in the
               pimStaticRPTable being created and destroyed.

            -  Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'configSsm'
               are created and destroyed as a result of configuration of
               SSM address ranges to the local router.

            -  Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'bsr' are
               created as a result of running the PIM Bootstrap Router
               (BSR) mechanism.  If the local router is not the elected
               BSR, these rows are created to correspond to group
               prefixes in the PIM Bootstrap messages received from the
               elected BSR.  If the local router is the elected BSR,
               these rows are created to correspond to group prefixes in
               the PIM Bootstrap messages that the local router sends.
               In either case, these rows are destroyed when the group
               prefixes are timed out by the BSR mechanism.

            -  Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'other' are
               created and destroyed according to some other mechanism
               not specified here.

            Given the collection of rows in this table at any point in
            time, the PIM mode and RP address to use for a particular
            group is determined using the following algorithm.

            1. From the set of all rows, the subset whose group prefix
               contains the group in question are selected.

            2. If there are no such rows, the behavior is undefined.

            3. If there is at least one such row, from the selected
               subset of rows, the subset that have the lowest value
               of pimGroupMappingPrecedence are selected.

            4. From the selected subset of rows, the subset that have
               the greatest value of pimGroupMappingGrpPrefixLength are
               selected.

            5. If there are multiple selected rows, the subset that have
               the highest precedence (the lowest numerical value for
               pimGroupMappingPrecedence) are selected.

            6. If there are multiple selected rows, the row selected is
               implementation dependent; the implementation might or
               might not apply the PIM hash function to select the row.

            7. The group mode to use is given by the value of
               pimGroupMappingPimMode from the single selected row; the
               RP to use is given by the value of
               pimGroupMappingRPAddress, unless pimGroupMappingOrigin is
               'embedded', in which case the RP is extracted from the
               group address in question."
