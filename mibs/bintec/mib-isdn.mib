		 In case of mismatch, contents of mentioned variabled might be
		 wrong and this circumstance is reflected in variable
		 isdnIfOperState. State reconfig may then be used in order to
		 cause an update of these variable as appropriate which ...
		   - will be signalled to higher protocol layers, and
