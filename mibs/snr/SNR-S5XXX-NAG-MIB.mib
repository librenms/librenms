         unknown(0)  An unknown address type.  This value MUST
                     be used if the value of the corresponding
                     InetAddress object is a zero-length string.
                     It may also be used to indicate an IP address
                     that is not in one of the formats defined
                     below.

                     InetAddressIPv4 textual convention.

         ipv6(2)     An IPv6 address as defined by the
                     InetAddressIPv6 textual convention.

         ipv4z(3)    A non-global IPv4 address including a zone
                     index as defined by the InetAddressIPv4z
                     textual convention.

         ipv6z(4)    A non-global IPv6 address including a zone
                     index as defined by the InetAddressIPv6z
                     textual convention.

         dns(16)     A DNS domain name as defined by the
                     InetAddressDNS textual convention.

         Each definition of a concrete InetAddressType value must be
         accompanied by a definition of a textual convention for use
         with that InetAddressType.

         To support future extensions, the InetAddressType textual
         convention SHOULD NOT be sub-typed in object type definitions.
         It MAY be sub-typed in compliance statements in order to
         require only a subset of these address types for a compliant
         implementation.

         Implementations must ensure that InetAddressType objects
         and any dependent objects (e.g., InetAddress objects) are
         consistent.  An inconsistentValue error must be generated
         if an attempt to change an InetAddressType object would,
         for example, lead to an undefined InetAddress value.  In

         particular, InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs must be
         changed together if the address type changes (e.g., from
         ipv6(2) to ipv4(1))."

InetAddress ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Denotes a generic Internet address.

         An InetAddress value is always interpreted within the context
         of an InetAddressType value.  Every usage of the InetAddress
         textual convention is required to specify the InetAddressType
         object that provides the context.  It is suggested that the
         InetAddressType object be logically registered before the
         object(s) that use the InetAddress textual convention, if
         they appear in the same logical row.

         The value of an InetAddress object must always be
         consistent with the value of the associated InetAddressType
         object.  Attempts to set an InetAddress object to a value
         inconsistent with the associated InetAddressType
         must fail with an inconsistentValue error.

         When this textual convention is used as the syntax of an
         index object, there may be issues with the limit of 128
         sub-identifiers specified in SMIv2, STD 58.  In this case,
         the object definition MUST include a 'SIZE' clause to
         limit the number of potential instance sub-identifiers;
         otherwise the applicable constraints MUST be stated in
         the appropriate conceptual row DESCRIPTION clauses, or
         in the surrounding documentation if there is no single
         DESCRIPTION clause that is appropriate."

         Within each octet, the most significant bit represents
         the lowest numbered vlan, and the least significant bit

        Within each octet, the most significant bit represents
        the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit
        represents the highest numbered port.  Thus, each port
        of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the
        value of this object.  If that bit has a value of '1'

    SnmpAdminString ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "255t"
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION "An octet string containing administrative
                 information, preferably in human-readable form.

                 To facilitate internationalization, this
                 information is represented using the ISO/IEC
                 IS 10646-1 character set, encoded as an octet
                 string using the UTF-8 transformation format
                 described in [RFC2279].

                 Since additional code points are added by
                 amendments to the 10646 standard from time
                 to time, implementations must be prepared to
                 encounter any code point from 0x00000000 to
                 0x7fffffff.  Byte sequences that do not
                 correspond to the valid UTF-8 encoding of a
                 code point or are outside this range are
                 prohibited.

                 The use of control codes should be avoided.

                 When it is necessary to represent a newline,
                 the control code sequence CR LF should be used.

                 The use of leading or trailing white space should
                 be avoided.

                 For code points not directly supported by user
                 interface hardware or software, an alternative
                 means of entry and display, such as hexadecimal,
                 may be provided.

                 For information encoded in 7-bit US-ASCII,
                 the UTF-8 encoding is identical to the
                 US-ASCII encoding.

                 UTF-8 may require multiple bytes to represent a
                 single character / code point; thus the length
                 of this object in octets may be different from
                 the number of characters encoded.  Similarly,
                 size constraints refer to the number of encoded
                 octets, not the number of characters represented
                 by an encoding.

                 Note that when this TC is used for an object that
                 is used or envisioned to be used as an index, then
                 a SIZE restriction MUST be specified so that the
                 number of sub-identifiers for any object instance
                 does not exceed the limit of 128, as defined by
                 [RFC3416].

                 Note that the size of an SnmpAdminString object is
                 measured in octets, not characters.

TimeFilter ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS        current
    DESCRIPTION





        "To be used for the index to a table.  Allows an application
        to download only those rows changed since a particular time.
        A row is considered changed if the value of any object in the
        row changes or if the row is created or deleted.

        When sysUpTime is equal to zero, this table shall be empty.

        One entry exists for each past value of sysUpTime, except that
        the whole table is purged should sysUpTime wrap.

        As this basic row is updated new conceptual rows are created
        (which still share the now updated object values with all
        other instances).  The number of instances which are created
        is determined by the value of sysUpTime at which the basic row
        was last updated.  One instance will exist for each value of
        sysUpTime at the last update time for the row.  A new
        timeMark instance is created for each new sysUpTime value.
        Each new conceptual row will be associated with the timeMark
        instance which was created at the value of sysUpTime with
        which the conceptual row is to be associated.

        By definition all conceptual rows were updated at or after
        time zero and so at least one conceptual row (associated with
        timeMark.0) must exist for each underlying (basic) row.

        See the appendix for further discussion of this variable.

        Consider the following fooTable:

        fooTable ...
        INDEX { fooTimeMark, fooIndex }

        FooEntry {
           fooTimeMark  TimeFilter
           fooIndex     INTEGER,
           fooCounts    Counter
        }

        Should there be two basic rows in this table (fooIndex == 1,
        fooIndex == 2) and row 1 was updated most recently at time 6,
        while row 2 was updated most recently at time 8, and both rows
        had been updated on several earlier occasions such that the
        current values were 5 and 9 respectively then the following
        fooCounts instances would exist.

        fooCounts.0.1  5
        fooCounts.0.2  9
