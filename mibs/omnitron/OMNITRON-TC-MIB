        index that is not currently used in the relevant table. The

        new row with an SNMP SET.  When the SET is performed, the
        Command Responder (agent) MUST determine whether the value is
        indeed still unused; Two Network Management Applications may
        attempt to create a row (configuration entry) simultaneously
        and use the same value. If it is currently unused, the SET
        succeeds and the Command Responder (agent) changes the value
        of this object, according to an implementation-specific
        algorithm.  If the value is in use, however, the SET fails.
        The Network Management Application MUST then re-read this
        variable to obtain a new usable value.

        An OBJECT-TYPE definition using this SYNTAX MUST specify the
        relevant table for which the object is providing this
