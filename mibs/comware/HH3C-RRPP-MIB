    DESCRIPTION
        "The RRPP (Rapid Ring Protection protocol) provides
        fast protection switching to layer 2 switches
        interconnected in an Ethernet ring topology.  When
        a link in the ring breaks, the RRPP can recover the
        data path quickly.  Its protection switching is
        similar to what can be achieved with the Spanning
        Tree Protocol (STP), but the converging time is less
        than a second after link failure.
        This MIB defines management information used on
        products which support RRPP."
