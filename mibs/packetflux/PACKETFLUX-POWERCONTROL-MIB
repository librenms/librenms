    STATUS        current
    DESCRIPTION
        "The user-settable description for this port. This should be

         what is attached to the port."

        "Whether the power has been shut down due to the detection of
         an overcurrent or other fault. This value overrides the
         powerEnabled value when true, ensuring that a port is shut down
         on fault. Write a '0'(false) to this OID to reset the trip."

         timer value to this OID to either start a cycle on the port (if
         this value is currently zero), or to change the amount of time
         left in the cycle (if a cycle is already in progress). A cycle
         will always toggle the current state of the port. So if the
         power on a port is disabled, writing a value to this OID will
         turn the port on, then back off which may not be what the
         operator desires."

    DESCRIPTION
        "Some power control points permit the injection of a timing

    STATUS        current
    DESCRIPTION
        "The output voltage for this port. Depending on the
         architecture of the injection card, this value may reflect
         either the switched or non-switched voltage."

    UNITS         "A"
    MAX-ACCESS    read-only
    STATUS        current
    DESCRIPTION
        "The current draw of the device attached to the port. It may
         also include some power consumed by the injection port itself.

         Note that this is reported from the controller with 6 fixed
         decimal digits which is enough to correctly represent mA and uA
         ranges.  Some SNMP tools will automatically put the decimal in
         the right spot. If not, you will need to divide this value by
         1,000,000 to get the value in Amps.   If you'd prefer this
         report in mA, you will need to either multiply or divide the
         value by 1000, depending on whether your SNMP tool correctly
         places the decimal point for Amps or not."
