Commonly dropped packets are multicast frames, spanning tree BPDUs, packets destined to a MAC not owned by the system when L2 mode is disabled, or packets tagged for a vlan that isnt bound to the interface.  This counter will increment in most healthy networks at a steady rate regardless of traffic load.  If a sharp spike in dropped packets occurs, it generally indicates an issue with connected L2 switches, such as a forwarding database overflow resulting in packets being broadcast on all ports."
