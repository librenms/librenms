         BIT 5 - OS Resource trace.
         BIT 6 - All Failure trace (All failures including Packet Validation)
         BIT 7 - Buffer Trace.

       Different submodule Tracing -
         BIT 16 - Tracing in VLAN module.
         BIT 17 - Tracing in VLAN Priority module.
         BIT 18 - Tracing in VLAN redundancy module.   

       The remaining bits are reserved. The combinations of levels and submodules 
       are allowed i.e. tracing can be allowed at all failure and data path 
       level in all submodules by setting the BIT appropriately.
       For example, setting the debug value to the following bit stream, 
          00000000000000010000000000000100 will enable data path trace 
       prints in VLAN module. Multiple submodules and multiple levels can
       be combined by setting the corresponding bits.
       For example, setting the debug value to the following bit stream,
          00000000000000110000000000001100 will enable data path and 
       control plane trace prints in VLAN and VLAN priority modules.

       significant bit."

         BIT 18 - Tracing in GVRP module.   
         BIT 19 - Tracing in GARP redundancy module.   

       The remaining bits are reserved. The combinations of levels and submodules 
       are allowed i.e. tracing can be allowed at all failure and data path 
       level in all sub modules by setting the bit appropriately.
       For Example, setting the debug value to the following bit stream, 
          00000000000000010000000000000100 will enable data path trace 
       prints in GARP module. Multiple sub modules and multiple levels can
       be combined by setting the corresponding bits.
       For example, setting the debug value to the following bit stream,
          00000000000001010000000000001100 will enable data path and 
       control plane trace prints in GARP and GVRP modules.
