   DESCRIPTION
      "This object is used to enable Trace Statements in the RSTP
      Module.

      A FOUR BYTE integer is used for enabling the level of tracing. 
      Each BIT in the four byte integer represents a particular 
      level of Trace. 

      The mapping between the bit positions & the level of trace is 
      as follows: 
      0 - Init and Shutdown Traces
      1 - Management Traces
      2 - Data Path Traces
      3 - Control Plane Traces
      4 - Packet Dump Traces
      5 - Traces related to All Resources except Buffers
      6 - All Failure Traces
      7 - Buffer Traces

      The remaining bits are unused. Combination of trace levels are 
      also allowed.

      For example if the bits 0 and 1 are set, then the Trace
      statements related to Init-Shutdown and management 
      will be printed.

      The user has to enter the corresponding INTEGER VALUE for the
      bits set. For example if bits 0 and 1 are to be set, then user has
      to give the value for this object as 3.
      
      Setting the Trace Option to any value will cause the Debug Option
      to be set to 0 (i.e.) the Trace Option and Debug Option are mutually
      exclusive."
