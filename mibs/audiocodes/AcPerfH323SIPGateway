    DESCRIPTION       
    "This MIB defines the enterprise-specific objects needed
     to support performance management of the AudioCodes product.
     Performance measurements are grouped into the following MIB trees:

            acPerfIvr  - performance measurements related to the IVR service
            acPerfBct  - performance measurements related to the BCT service
            acPerfConf - performance measurements related to the Conferencing service
            acPerfTt   - performance measurements related to the Test Trunk service"


    REVISION "200311200000Z"
       DESCRIPTION
         "Version 4.4. November 20, 2003. Made these changes:
             o  Initial revision"

    ::= {acPerformance 3}

--
-- Abbreviations used:
--   Annc       announcement(s)
--   IVR        Interactive Voice Response
--   Conf       Conferencing
--   NE         network element
--   TT         Test Trunks
--

-- The following conventions are used in this MIB:

--   The "Product" attribute lists the products in which the
--   performance measurement is maintained. Current products
--   are:
--
--     Media Servers
--       IPmedia 2000
--     Media Gateways
--       Mediant 2000/5000/8000 (wireline)
--       Stretto 2000/5000/8000 (wireless)
--

--   The "Capabilities" attribute lists the capabilities that must be
--   configured on the system for the performance measurement to be
--   maintained.  The possible values are IVR, Conferencing, BCT, TT
--   and Trunking Gateway. Some performance measurements are not
--   related to any particular capabilities. In those cases, the value
--   of Capabilities attribute is "All".

--
-- Notes on IVR Service Performance Measurements
--

-- In response to a request to play an announcement, the media server
-- may play multiple audio segments. The media server maintains
-- performance data for the overall announcement request as well as
-- for the individual segments.

-- In naming of the performance measurements, "Play" is used to refer
-- to the overall announcement request. "PlaySegment" is used to refer
-- to the playing of an individual segment.

--
-- Notes on Play Collect
--

-- Play Collect involves playing of an initial prompt, collection of digits, followed
-- by actions which are dependent on the digits (or lack of digits) that are collected.
-- These are the prompts that can be specified (all are optional):
--
--    ip    initial prompt
--    nd    no digits reprompt (if not specified, use rp)
--    rp    reprompt (if not specified, use ip)
--    fa    failure, played once at end
--    sa    success, played once at end
--
-- The request can specify the number of attempts, before playing the fa prompt. If no
-- number of attempts value is supplied on the request, then a default is used.
--
-- The prompts can be either simple or complex announcements.
--
-- Continuous Digit Collect operations, which can be considered a special type of play
-- collect, are not tracked by any of the acPlayCollect performance measurements,
-- but are instead tracked in a special group of performance measurements.

--
-- Notes on Continuous Digit Collect
--

-- Continuous Digit Collect - Digits are collected during the entire
-- life of a call. No prompts are played.  Continuous Digit Collect
-- is typically used in a BCT call.
--
-- Continuous Digit Collect operations can be considered a special type of play
-- collect, but are not tracked by any of the acPlayCollect performance measurements.
