    DESCRIPTION       
    "This MIB defines the enterprise-specific objects needed
     to support performance management of the AudioCodes product.
     Performance measurements are grouped into the following MIB trees:

            acPerfCp     - performance measurements related to the control protocol
            acPerfRtp    - performance measurements related to RTP streams
            acPerfSystem - performance measurements related to network element as a whole"

--   CP         Control Protocol
--   NE         network element
--   TT         Test Trunks

-- The following conventions are used in this MIB:

--   The "Product" attribute lists the products in which the
--   performance measurement is maintained. Current products
--   are:
--
--     Media Servers
--       IPmedia 2000
--     Media Gateways
--       Mediant 2000/5000/8000 (wireline)
--       Stretto 2000/5000/8000 (wireless)
--

--   The "Capabilities" attribute lists the capabilities that must be
--   configured on the system for the performance measurement to be
--   maintained.  The possible values are IVR, Conferencing, BCT, TT
--   and Trunking Gateway. Some performance measurements are not
--   related to any particular capabilities. In those cases, the value
--   of Capabilities attribute is "All".
