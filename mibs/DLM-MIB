        DESCRIPTION
                "A list of SNMP poll entries which trigger automatic polling
                of SNMP requests to other SNMP agents.  This table is indexed 
                by the destination IP address of the host/device to be polled
                and the IP address of the requesting host.  This indexing pair 
                allows multiple requestors to define a poll request to the same 
                destination, yet maintain separate poll entries.

                The OIDs to be polled in this request are defined in the 
                snmpOIDTable which is indexed also by the destination/owner
                IP address pair.  If no OIDs are defined for a poll entry, then
                the the poll will default to polling for sysUpTimei with no
                threshold comparison.  This will act as a simple keep-alive
                funtion for the destination SNMP agent."
