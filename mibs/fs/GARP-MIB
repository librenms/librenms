TimeFilter ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS        current
    DESCRIPTION
        "To be used for the index to a table.  Allows an application
        to download only those rows changed since a particular time.
        A row is considered changed if the value of any object in the
        row changes or if the row is created or deleted.

        When sysUpTime is equal to zero, this table shall be empty.

        One entry exists for each past value of sysUpTime, except that
        the whole table is purged should sysUpTime wrap.

        As this basic row is updated new conceptual rows are created
        (which still share the now updated object values with all
        other instances).  The number of instances which are created
        is determined by the value of sysUpTime at which the basic row
        was last updated.  One instance will exist for each value of
        sysUpTime at the last update time for the row.  A new
        timeMark instance is created for each new sysUpTime value.
        Each new conceptual row will be associated with the timeMark
        instance which was created at the value of sysUpTime with
        which the conceptual row is to be associated.

        By definition all conceptual rows were updated at or after
        time zero and so at least one conceptual row (associated with
        timeMark.0) must exist for each underlying (basic) row.

        See the appendix for further discussion of this variable.

        Consider the following fooTable:

        fooTable ...
        INDEX { fooTimeMark, fooIndex }

        FooEntry {
           fooTimeMark  TimeFilter
           fooIndex     INTEGER,
           fooCounts    Counter
        }

        Should there be two basic rows in this table (fooIndex == 1,
        fooIndex == 2) and row 1 was updated most recently at time 6,
        while row 2 was updated most recently at time 8, and both rows
        had been updated on several earlier occasions such that the
        current values were 5 and 9 respectively then the following
        fooCounts instances would exist.

        fooCounts.0.1  5
        fooCounts.0.2  9
        fooCounts.1.1  5
        fooCounts.1.2  9
        fooCounts.2.1  5
        fooCounts.2.2  9
        fooCounts.3.1  5
        fooCounts.3.2  9
        fooCounts.4.1  5
        fooCounts.4.2  9
        fooCounts.5.1  5
        fooCounts.5.2  9

PortList ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Each octet within this value specifies a set of eight
        ports, with the first octet specifying ports 1 through
        8, the second octet specifying ports 9 through 16, etc.
        Within each octet, the most significant bit represents
        the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit
        represents the highest numbered port.  Thus, each port
        of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the
        value of this object.  If that bit has a value of '1'
        then that port is included in the set of ports; the port
        is not included if its bit has a value of '0'."

        global scope within a given bridged domain (see VlanId
        textual convention).  If the value is greater than 4095
        then it represents a VLAN with scope local to the
        particular agent, i.e. one without a global VLAN-ID
        assigned to it. Such VLANs are outside the scope of
        IEEE 802.1Q but it is convenient to be able to manage them
        in the same way using this MIB."
