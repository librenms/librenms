      DESCRIPTION
          "The best estimate of the total number of collisions
          on this Ethernet segment.

          The value returned will depend on the location of
          the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and
          section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3
          states that a station must detect a collision, in
          the receive mode, if three or more stations are
          transmitting simultaneously.  A repeater port must
          detect a collision when two or more stations are
          transmitting simultaneously.  Thus a probe placed on
          a repeater port could record more collisions than a
          probe connected to a station on the same segment
          would.

          Probe location plays a much smaller role when
          considering 10BASE-T.  14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE
          standard 802.3 defines a collision as the
          simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD
          circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same
          time).  A 10BASE-T station can only detect
          collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes
          placed on a station and a repeater, should report
          the same number of collisions.

          Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater
          should ideally report collisions between the
          repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit
          collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver
          collisions observed on any coax segments to which
          the repeater is connected."

      DESCRIPTION
          "The best estimate of the total number of collisions
          on this Ethernet segment.

          The value returned will depend on the location of
          the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and
          section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3
          states that a station must detect a collision, in
          the receive mode, if three or more stations are
          transmitting simultaneously.  A repeater port must
          detect a collision when two or more stations are
          transmitting simultaneously.  Thus a probe placed on
          a repeater port could record more collisions than a
          probe connected to a station on the same segment
          would.

          Probe location plays a much smaller role when
          considering 10BASE-T.  14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE
          standard 802.3 defines a collision as the
          simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD
          circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same
          time).  A 10BASE-T station can only detect
          collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes
          placed on a station and a repeater, should report
          the same number of collisions.

          Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater
          should ideally report collisions between the
          repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit
          collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver
          collisions observed on any coax segments to which
          the repeater is connected."
