EnabledStatus ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A simple status value for the object."
    SYNTAX      INTEGER { enabled(1), disabled(2) }

PortList ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Each octet within this value specifies a set of eight
        ports, with the first octet specifying ports 1 through
        8, the second octet specifying ports 9 through 16, etc.
        Within each octet, the most significant bit represents
        the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit
        represents the highest numbered port.  Thus, each port
        of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the
        value of this object.  If that bit has a value of '1'
        then that port is included in the set of ports; the port
        is not included if its bit has a value of '0'."
    SYNTAX      OCTET STRING

VlanIndex ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A value used to index per-VLAN tables: values of 0 and
        4095 are not permitted; if the value is between 1 and
        4094 inclusive, it represents an IEEE 802.1Q VLAN-ID with
        global scope within a given bridged domain (see VlanId
        textual convention).  If the value is greater than 4095
        then it represents a VLAN with scope local to the
        particular agent, i.e. one without a global VLAN-ID
        assigned to it. Such VLANs are outside the scope of
        IEEE 802.1Q but it is convenient to be able to manage them
        in the same way using this MIB."
    SYNTAX      Unsigned32

TimeFilter ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS        current
    DESCRIPTION
        "To be used for the index to a table.  Allows an application
        to download only those rows changed since a particular time.
        A row is considered changed if the value of any object in the
        row changes or if the row is created or deleted.

        When sysUpTime is equal to zero, this table shall be empty.

        One entry exists for each past value of sysUpTime, except that
        the whole table is purged should sysUpTime wrap.

        As this basic row is updated new conceptual rows are created
        (which still share the now updated object values with all
        other instances).  The number of instances which are created
        is determined by the value of sysUpTime at which the basic row
        was last updated.  One instance will exist for each value of
        sysUpTime at the last update time for the row.  A new
        timeMark instance is created for each new sysUpTime value.
        Each new conceptual row will be associated with the timeMark
        instance which was created at the value of sysUpTime with
        which the conceptual row is to be associated.

        By definition all conceptual rows were updated at or after
        time zero and so at least one conceptual row (associated with
        timeMark.0) must exist for each underlying (basic) row.

        See the appendix for further discussion of this variable.

        Consider the following fooTable:

        fooTable ...
        INDEX { fooTimeMark, fooIndex }

        FooEntry {
           fooTimeMark  TimeFilter
           fooIndex     INTEGER,
           fooCounts    Counter
        }

        Should there be two basic rows in this table (fooIndex == 1,
        fooIndex == 2) and row 1 was updated most recently at time 6,
        while row 2 was updated most recently at time 8, and both rows
        had been updated on several earlier occasions such that the
        current values were 5 and 9 respectively then the following
        fooCounts instances would exist.

        fooCounts.0.1  5
        fooCounts.0.2  9
        fooCounts.1.1  5
        fooCounts.1.2  9
        fooCounts.2.1  5
        fooCounts.2.2  9
        fooCounts.3.1  5
        fooCounts.3.2  9
        fooCounts.4.1  5
        fooCounts.4.2  9
        fooCounts.5.1  5
        fooCounts.5.2  9
        fooCounts.6.1  5
        fooCounts.6.2  9
        fooCounts.7.2  9    -- note that row 1 doesn't exist for
        fooCounts.8.2  9    -- times 7 and 8"

      DESCRIPTION
          "The best estimate of the total number of collisions
          on this Ethernet segment.

          The value returned will depend on the location of
          the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and
          section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3
          states that a station must detect a collision, in
          the receive mode, if three or more stations are
          transmitting simultaneously.  A repeater port must
          detect a collision when two or more stations are
          transmitting simultaneously.  Thus a probe placed on
          a repeater port could record more collisions than a
          probe connected to a station on the same segment
          would.

          Probe location plays a much smaller role when
          considering 10BASE-T.  14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE
          standard 802.3 defines a collision as the
          simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD
          circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same
          time).  A 10BASE-T station can only detect
          collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes
          placed on a station and a repeater, should report
          the same number of collisions.

          Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater
          should ideally report collisions between the
          repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit
          collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver
          collisions observed on any coax segments to which
          the repeater is connected."

           DESCRIPTION "If the MAU is a link or fiber type (FOIRL,
                       10BASE-T, 10BASE-F) then this is equivalent to
                       the link test fail state/low light function.
                       For an AUI or a coax (including broadband) MAU
                       this indicates whether or not loopback is
                       detected on the DI circuit.  The value of this
                       attribute persists between packets for MAU types
                       AUI, 10BASE5, 10BASE2, 10BROAD36, and 10BASE-FP.

                       The value other(1) is returned if the
                       mediaAvailable state is not one of 2 through 11.
                       The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
                       true state is unknown; for example, when it is
                       being initialized.  At power-up or following a
                       reset, the value of this attribute will be
                       unknown for AUI, coax, and 10BASE-FP MAUs.  For
                       these MAUs loopback will be tested on each
                       transmission during which no collision is
                       detected.  If DI is receiving input when DO
                       returns to IDL after a transmission and there
                       has been no collision during the transmission
                       then loopback will be detected.  The value of
                       this attribute will only change during
                       non-collided transmissions for AUI, coax, and
                       10BASE-FP MAUs.

                       For 100Mbps and 1000Mbps MAUs, the enumerations
                       match the states within the respective link
                       integrity state diagrams, fig 32-16, 23-12 and
                       24-15 of sections 32, 23 and 24 of [2].  Any MAU
                       which implements management of auto-negotiation
                       will map remote fault indication to remote
                       fault.

                       The value available(3) indicates that the link,
                       light, or loopback is normal.  The value
                       notAvailable(4) indicates link loss, low light,
                       or no loopback.

                       The value remoteFault(5) indicates that a fault
                       has been detected at the remote end of the link.
                       This value applies to 10BASE-FB, 100BASE-T4 Far
                       End Fault Indication and non-specified remote
                       faults from a system running auto-negotiation.
                       The values remoteJabber(7), remoteLinkLoss(8),
                       and remoteTest(9) SHOULD be used instead of
                       remoteFault(5) where the reason for remote fault
                       is identified in the remote signaling protocol.

                       The value invalidSignal(6) indicates that an
                       invalid signal has been received from the other
                       end of the link.  InvalidSignal(6) applies only
                       to MAUs of type 10BASE-FB.

                       Where an IEEE Std 802.3u-1995 clause 22 MII
                       is present, a logic one in the remote fault bit
                       (reference section 22.2.4.2.8 of that document)
                       maps to the value remoteFault(5), and a logic
                       zero in the link status bit (reference section
                       22.2.4.2.10 of that document) maps to the value
                       notAvailable(4).  The value notAvailable(4)
                       takes precedence over the value remoteFault(5).

                       Any MAU that implements management of clause 37
                       Auto-Negotiation will map the received RF1 and
                       RF2 bit values for Offline to offline(10), Link
                       Failure to remoteFault(5) and Auto-Negotiation
                       Error to autoNegError(11)."

               by sIfMauType.

               The set of possible values for this object is the
               same as the set defined for the sIfMauType object.

               This object represents the administratively-
               configured type of the MAU.  If auto-negotiation
               is not enabled or is not implemented for this MAU,

               specified operating mode.

               If auto-negotiation is implemented and enabled for
               this MAU, the operational type of the MAU is
               determined by auto-negotiation, and the value of

        DESCRIPTION 
        "The current mode of operation of the MAC
        entity.  'unknown' indicates that the current
        duplex mode could not be determined.

        Management control of the duplex mode is
        accomplished through the MAU MIB.  When
        an interface does not support autonegotiation,
        or when autonegotiation is not enabled, the
        duplex mode is controlled using
        ifMauDefaultType.  When autonegotiation is
        supported and enabled, duplex mode is controlled
        using ifMauAutoNegAdvertisedBits.  In either
        case, the currently operating duplex mode is
        reflected both in this object and in ifMauType.

        Note that this object provides redundant
        information with ifMauType.  Normally, redundant
        objects are discouraged.  However, in this
        instance, it allows a management application to
        determine the duplex status of an interface
        without having to know every possible value of
        ifMauType.  This was felt to be sufficiently
        valuable to justify the redundancy."
