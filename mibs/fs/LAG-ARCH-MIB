		DESCRIPTION
			"The unique identifier allocated to this Aggregator by the

		DESCRIPTION
			" The Rule to be applied to this Link Aggregator's Trunk Group
			Table. The rules are based on the following selections SrcMAC (1),
			means that the last three bits of the Source MAC Address are used to
			index the Trunk Group to get the destination port. DestMAC (2), means
			the last three bits of the Destination MAC Address are used to index 
			into the Trunk Group to get the destination port. SrcXORDestMAC (3),
			means that the last three bits of the Source MAC Address are logically
			XORed with the last three bits of the Destination MAC Address and used
			to index into the Trunk Group to get the destination port. SrcIP (4),
			means the last three bits of the Source IP Address are used to index
			into the Trunk Group to get the destination port. DestIP (5), means
			the last three bits of the Destination IP Address are used to index
			into the Trunk Group to get the destination port. SrcXORDestIP (6),
			means the last three bits of the Source IP Address are logically XORed
			with the last three bits of the Destination IP Address and used to 
			index into the Trunk Group to get the destination port. This rule
			defines the distribution algorithm applied to the aggregated link."
