          -- Protocol to uniquely identify a bridge.  Its first two
          -- octets (in network byte order) contain a priority
          -- value and its last 6 octets contain the MAC address
          -- used to refer to a bridge in a unique fashion
          -- (typically, the numerically smallest MAC address
          -- of all ports on the bridge).
          -- Several objects in this MIB module represent values of
          -- timers used by the Spanning Tree Protocol.  In this
          -- MIB, these timers have values in units of hundreths of
          -- a second (i.e. 1/100 secs).
          -- These timers, when stored in a Spanning Tree Protocol's
          -- BPDU, are in units of 1/256 seconds.  Note, however,
          -- that 802.1D-1990 specifies a settable granularity of
          -- no more than 1 second for these timers.  To avoid
          -- ambiguity, a data type is defined here as a textual
          -- convention and all representation of these timers
          -- in this MIB module are defined using this data type.  An
          -- algorithm is also defined for converting between the
          -- different units, to ensure a timer's value is not
          -- distorted by multiple conversions.
          -- The data type is:

          Timeout ::= INTEGER -- a STP timer in units of 1/100 seconds

          -- To convert a Timeout value into a value in units of
          -- 1/256 seconds, the following algorithm should be used:
          --
          --      b  = floor( (n * 256) / 100)
          --
          -- where:
          --      floor   =  quotient [ignore remainder]
          --      n is the value in 1/100 second units
          --      b is the value in 1/256 second units
          --
          -- To convert the value from 1/256 second units back to
          -- 1/100 seconds, the following algorithm should be used:
          --
          --      n = ceiling( (b * 100) / 256)
          --
          -- where:
          --      ceiling =  quotient [if remainder is 0], or
          --                 quotient + 1 [if remainder is non-zero]
          --      n is the value in 1/100 second units
          --      b is the value in 1/256 second units
          --
          -- Note: it is important that the arithmetic operations are
