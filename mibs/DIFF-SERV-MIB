    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "The Queue Table enumerates the queues  on an interface.
         Queues are used to store traffic during intervals when
         the arrival rate exceeds the departure rate for a class
         of traffic. Because some PHBs indicate that the use of
         a priority queue may be advisable, each queue in this
         system is seen as having a priority. Those queues that
         share the same priority operate in what may externally
         appear to be a Weighted Round Robin manner, and preempt
         the traffic belonging to any lower priority. For this
         reason, it is strongly urged that traffic placed into
         prioritized queues be strongly policed to avoid traffic
         lockout.
         Queues in this table also have a minimum and a maximum
         rate.  When a maximum rate is specified, the queue acts
         as a shaper if it has sufficient traffic and capacity
         is available.  If it is a minimum rate, then the weight
         in the WRR is effectively set to this rate divided by
         the sum of the rates of queues on the interface,
         guaranteeing it at least that throughput rate. If it is
         a maximum rate, the queue operates as a shaper. A
         shaper potentially reduces the rate of traffic through
         it to the indicated rate, and minimizes variations in
