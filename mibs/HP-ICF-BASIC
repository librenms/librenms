                    This table is used to map an interface index to a
                    logical entity index.  This table is mainly used
                    by autodiscovery to figure out which entLogicalIndex
                    corresponds to a particular network address.  This
                    table is not intended as a general purpose mapping.
                    In particular, in some systems the same interface
                    can be in use by multiple logical entities.  Also,
                    there is no requirement that ifIndex is unique
                    across all logical entities (such as the case where
                    multiple agents in the same chassis each assign
                    ifIndex without knowledge of how the other agents
                    are assigning ifIndex).  Therefore, these mappings
                    are only defined to hold for the special purpose
                    of getting from the discovered transport address for
                    a logical device to the entLogicalIndex needed for
                    announce address and search address.  Also, note
                    that this table will not contain entries for all
                    of the values of ifIndex.  It will only contain
                    entries for interfaces that can be used for sending
                    announcement packets for some logical entity."

                    The type of events that will be sent to this trap

                    This filter is specified as a sum of values, where

                    4          debug events (HP internal use only)

        DESCRIPTION "An hpicfSelfTestTrap indicates that the agent has
                    detected a non-critical failure.  The value of the
                    hpicfSelfTestResultText object describing the failure
                    is sent in the trap.  Note that this trap is sent
                    whenever a new failure is detected.

                    An agent should throttle the generation of
                    consecutive hpicfSelfTestTraps so that there is at
                    least a five-second gap between traps of this type.
                    When traps are throttled, the are dropped, not
                    queued for sending at a future time.  (Note that
                    'generating' a trap means sending to all configured
                    recipients.)."

        DESCRIPTION "The type of events that will be sent to this trap
                    receiver.  This filter is mainly used for limiting
                    'system event' traps that will be sent to a specific
                    receiver.

                    This filter is specified as a sum of values, where
                    each value specifies a classification of traps that
                    will be sent to this trap receiver.  The value for a
                    particular trap class C is computed as 2 raised to
                    a value representing C.  The trap classes are
                    defined as follows:

                    C (bit#)   Trap class
                    -----------------------------------------------
                    0          SNMP traps

                    4          debug events (HP internal use only)

                    For example, to specify that this trap receiver
                    should recieve SNMP traps and critical event traps,
                    this object should be set to a value of 9 (2^0 +
                    2^3).

                    Note that some agents may not support
                    trap filtering.  Those agents may either implement
                    this object as read-only, or with a restricted
                    write syntax."
