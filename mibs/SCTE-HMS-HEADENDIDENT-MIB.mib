    DESCRIPTION
            "The MIB module is for representing optical equipment
             present in the headend (or indoor) and is supported by
             a SNMP agent. This module defines the root OID (under
             the scteHmsTree) for the indoor optic device MIBs such
             as Optical transmitters, receivers, amplifiers etc.
             This module also defines textual conventions that are
             common across indoor devices."
