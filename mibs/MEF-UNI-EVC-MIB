       STATUS       current
       DESCRIPTION
           "An octet string containing a list of item values.

            An item value is an arbitrary string of octets from
            ASCII character 0x21 - 0x7E, but may not contain 
            a delimiter character. Delimiter characters are 
            defined to be one of the following:

                -  An ASCII comma character (0x2C)
                -  An ASCII colon character (0x3A)

            Delimiter characters are used to separate item values
            in a item list.  Only a single delimiter character may
            occur between two item values.  A item value may not
            have a zero length.  These constraints imply certain
            restrictions on the contents of this object:

                - There cannot be a leading or trailing delimiter
                  character.

                - There cannot be multiple adjacent delimiter
                  characters.

            The 'comma' delimiter separates individual items or a
            sequence of items. The 'colon' delimiter indicates a range
            of items from the first item before the colon through the
            last item after the colon. Individual ranges in the same
            item list need to be separated by a 'comma'.

            Some examples of valid item lists are:

                - ''            -- an empty list
                - '1234'        -- list of one item
                - '10,11,12'    -- list of several items
                - '10:20'       -- a list containing all the valid values from
                                   10 through 20

            Note that although an item value may not have a length of
            zero, an empty string is still valid.  This indicates
            an empty list (i.e. there are no tag values in the list).

            The use of the item list is to select one or more items at
            one time with a single object instead of having separate row
            entries in a table for each individual item.

        the mefServiceBwpCfgTable. 

        A row in this table is deleted when a row in the mefServiceBwpCfgTable
        is deleted. Counters in the table are only enabled when the associated
        object, mefServiceBwpCfgPerformanceEnable, is enabled. 

        Rows in this table are accessed via the bandwidth profile group 
        object mefServiceBwpGrpCfgIndex and the individual bandwidth profile
        in the group by the mefServiceBwpCfgIndex object. A SNMP Manager 
        can access objects in each of the rows in the table.

        Rows in this table are persistent (non-volatile) upon reboot, but the
        values of the objects in a row are not persistent.
