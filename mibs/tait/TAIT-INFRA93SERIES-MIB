    REVISION      "201401010000Z"
    DESCRIPTION   "These versions were recorded prior to utilization of the MODULE-IDENTITY change log:
                   1.03.02 - Modified textual convention for states of logical channels, OFF(0)=>INACTIVE(0)
                   1.03.01 - Updated description for dmr-two-slot-data now that it is supported

                   1.00.04 - New standalone node alarms
                             Two alarms have been added for the standalone node. This resulted in two new traps:
                             systemFallbackControlled and systemDuplicateNodePriority. Also two new OIDs in the MIB:
                             systemAlarmFallbackControlled and systemAlarmDuplicateNodePriority
                   1.00.03 - Modifications to names of states
                              ControlProtocolStatus:

                                 unconnected(1) enum has been DEPRECATED and will no longer be used by new base station
                                                software.
                                 idle(2) enum has been renamed to standby(2)

                                 The consequences for mismatched old base stations with new MIBs and new base
                                 stations with old MIBs are as follows:

                                    Old base station queried with new MIBs in NMS:
                                    offline(0)     => unconnected(0)
                                    unconnected(1) => deprecated_unconnected(1)
                                    idle(2)        => standby(2)

                                    New base station queried with old MIBs in NMS:
                                    unconnected(0) => offline(0)
                                    standby(2) => idle(2)

                              LogicalChannelState:
                                 offline(0) enum has been renamed to off(0)

                                           Most likely causes for packets being late are jitter, delay and configuration errors.
                                           Most likely cause for packets being too early is preemption.

                              DESCRIPTION "The Synchronization status indicates whether the base station's transmission is synchronized and if not then gives reasons why. A base station transmitter in a simulcast channel group must be synchronized for simulcast operation. An unsynchronized base station does not transmit, unless it is specifically configured to transmit even though unsynchronized.
                                           Range:
                                           no-license(0): The base station does not have a license to operate in Simulcast mode.
                                           non-simulcast-operation(1): The current channel profile does not enable simulcast.
                                           bad-frequency-reference(2): The base station has frequency reference either faulty or absent and is therefore unsynchronized.
                                           never-had-1pps(3): The base station has never had a 1PPS. It is either faulty or absent and is therefore unsynchronized.
                                           never-had-ntp(4): The base station has never had NTP so it is therefore unsynchronized.
                                           missing-1pps-or-ntp(5): 1PPS or NTP is faulty or absent after initial synchronisation.
                                           synchronized(6): The transmitter is able to synchronize its transmissions with the other members of the channel group. Simulcast is functioning properly.
                                           non-channelgroup-operation(7):The current channel profile does not enable channel group operation."
