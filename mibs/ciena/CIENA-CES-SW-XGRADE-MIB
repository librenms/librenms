     DESCRIPTION
         "The possible operations for upgrading the software, including:
               
         none:  No upgrade operation is selected.

         download: This operation is to initiate the file transfer of the software package 
         from the TFTP server specified by cienaCesSwXgradePackagePath to 
         cienaCesSwXgradeDestPath. The default TFTP server is used for file transfer 
         if the cienaCesSwXgradeTftpServer is set to an empty string.
                     
         install: This operation is to install the software to the standby CTM (if present)
         and all line modules. The image files are either stored in the TFTP server 
         specified by cienaCesSwXgradePackagePath and cienaCesSwXgradeTftpServer or in 
         the compact flash of the active CTM.
                            
         activate: This operation is to activate any new software installed on all the modules. 
         The system automatically reverts to the previous software package if a protect operation 
         is not set within a time period specified by cienaCesSwXgradeRevertTimeout. If no time 
         period is specified (cienaCesSwXgradeRevertTimeout value 0), then the system does not 
         revert automatically and remains in the unprotected state indefinitely. 
         WARNING: Activating software requires a system restart.
                                           
         protect: This operation protects a new software package. If the protect operation 
         is not entered before the protect timeout is reached (specified by 
         cienaCesSwXgradeReverTimeout), the system automatically reverts to the previous
         software package.  

         revert: This operation reverts to the previous software package.

         validate: This operation validates the software package at the location specified by 
         the cienaCesSwXgradePackagePath. Setting the cienaCesSwXgradePackagePath to an empty 
         string validates the installed software.

         run: This operation refers to the downloading, parsing, and executing of a specified 
         command file as initiated through CLI, DHCP, or the file transfer MIB module. This is 
         used in appropriate notifications to report the completion of such event. An error is 
         returned when this object is attempted to be set to this value using an SNMP set-request.

	 remove: This operation is to remove an installed software package from the CTMs and 
	 all line modules."
