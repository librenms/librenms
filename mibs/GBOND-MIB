    DESCRIPTION
      "The objects in this MIB module are used to manage the
      multi-pair bonded xDSL Interfaces, defined in ITU-T
      recommendations G.998.1, G.998.2 and G.998.3.

      This MIB module MUST be used in conjunction with a bonding
      scheme specific MIB module, that is, G9981-MIB, G9982-MIB or
      G9983-MIB.

      The following references are used throughout this MIB module:

      [G.998.1] refers to:
        ITU-T Recommendation G.998.1: 'ATM-based multi-pair bonding',
        January 2005.

      [G.998.2] refers to:
        ITU-T Recommendation G.998.2: 'Ethernet-based multi-pair
        bonding', January 2005.

      [G.998.3] refers to:
        ITU-T Recommendation G.998.3: 'Multi-pair bonding using
        time-division inverse multiplexing', January 2005.

       data rate has reached/dropped below or exceeded the low
       upstream rate threshold, specified by
       gBondPortConfThreshLowUpRate.

       This notification MAY be sent for the -O subtype ports
       while the port is up, on the crossing event in both
       directions: from normal (rate is above the threshold) to low
       (rate equals the threshold or below it) and from low to
       normal. This notification is not applicable to the -R
       subtypes.

       It is RECOMMENDED that a small debouncing period of 2.5 sec,
       between the detection of the condition and notification,
       is implemented to prevent simultaneous LinkUp/LinkDown and
       gBondLowUpRateCrossing notifications to be sent.

       The adaptive nature of the G.Bond technology allows the port
       to adapt itself to the changes in the copper environment,
       e.g., an impulse noise, alien crosstalk, or a
       micro-interruption may temporarily drop one or more BCEs in
       the aggregation group, causing a rate degradation of the
       aggregated G.Bond link. The dropped BCEs would then try to
       re-initialize, possibly at a lower rate than before, adjusting
       the rate to provide required target SNR margin.
