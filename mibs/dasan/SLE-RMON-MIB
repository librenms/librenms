--   This data type is used to model an administratively
-- assigned name of the owner of a resource. This
-- information is taken from the NVT ASCII character
-- set.  It is suggested that this name contain one or
-- more of the following: IP address, management station
-- name, network manager's name, location, or phone
-- number.
-- In some cases the agent itself will be the owner of
-- an entry.  In these cases, this string shall be set
-- to a string starting with 'monitor'.
-- 
-- SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms
-- of the contents of MIB views; access to a particular
-- SNMP object instance depends only upon its presence
-- or absence in a particular MIB view and never upon
-- its value or the value of related object instances.
-- Thus, objects of this type afford resolution of
-- resource contention only among cooperating managers;
-- they realize no access control function with respect
-- to uncooperative parties.
-- 
-- By convention, objects with this syntax are declared as
-- having

--   The sleHistory Control Group
-- Implementation of the History Control group is optional.
-- 
-- The sleHistory control group controls the periodic statistical
-- sampling of data from various types of networks.  The
-- historyControlTable stores configuration entries that each
-- define an interface, polling period, and other parameters.
-- Once samples are taken, their data is stored in an entry
-- in a media-specific table.  Each such entry defines one
-- sample, and is associated with the historyControlEntry that
-- caused the sample to be taken.  Each counter in the
-- etherHistoryEntry counts the same event as its
-- similarly-named counterpart in the etherStatsEntry,
-- except that each value here is a cumulative sum during a
-- sampling period.
-- 
-- If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should
-- start the first sample of the history at a time such that
-- when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is
-- started at that instant.  This tends to make more
-- user-friendly reports, and enables comparison of reports
-- from different probes that have relatively accurate time
-- of day.
-- 
-- The probe is encouraged to add two history control entries
-- per monitored interface upon initialization that describe
-- a short term and a long term polling period.  Suggested
-- parameters are 30 seconds for the short term polling period
-- and 30 minutes for the long term period.

--   The sleAlarm Group

-- The sleAlarm Group requires the implementation of the Event

-- 
-- The sleAlarm group periodically takes
-- statistical samples from variables in the probe and
-- compares them to thresholds that have been
-- configured.  The alarm table stores configuration
-- entries that each define a variable, polling period,
-- and threshold parameters.  If a sample is found to
-- cross the threshold values, an event is generated.
-- Only variables that resolve to an ASN.1 primitive
-- type of INTEGER (INTEGER, Counter, Gauge, or
-- TimeTicks) may be monitored in this way.
-- 
-- This function has a hysteresis mechanism to limit
-- the generation of events.  This mechanism generates
-- one event as a threshold is crossed in the
-- appropriate direction.  No more events are generated
-- for that threshold until the opposite threshold is
-- crossed.
-- 
-- In the case of a sampling a deltaValue, a probe may
-- implement this mechanism with more precision if it
-- takes a delta sample twice per period, each time
-- comparing the sum of the latest two samples to the
-- threshold.  This allows the detection of threshold
-- crossings that span the sampling boundary.  Note
-- that this does not require any special configuration
-- of the threshold value.  It is suggested that probes

-- Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to
-- receive tabular information from agents that
-- corresponds to entries currently not in use.  Proper
-- interpretation of such entries requires examination
-- of the relevant EntryStatus object.
-- 
-- An existing instance of this object cannot be set to
-- createRequest(2).  This object may only be set to
-- createRequest(2) when this instance is created.  When
-- this object is created, the agent may wish to create
-- supplemental object instances with default values
-- to complete a conceptual row in this table.  Because
-- the creation of these default objects is entirely at
-- the option of the agent, the manager must not assume
-- that any will be created, but may make use of any that
-- are created. Immediately after completing the create
-- operation, the agent must set this object to
-- underCreation(3).
-- 
-- When in the underCreation(3) state, an entry is
-- allowed to exist in a possibly incomplete, possibly
-- inconsistent state, usually to allow it to be
-- modified in mutiple PDUs.  When in this state, an
-- entry is not fully active.  Entries shall exist in
-- the underCreation(3) state until the management
-- station is finisled configuring the entry and sets
-- this object to valid(1) or aborts, setting this
-- object to invalid(4).  If the agent determines that
-- an entry has been in the underCreation(3) state for
-- an abnormally long time, it may decide that the
-- management station has crasled.  If the agent makes
-- this decision, it may set this object to invalid(4)
-- to reclaim the entry.  A prudent agent will
-- understand that the management station may need to
-- wait for human input and will allow for that
-- possibility in its determination of this abnormally
-- long period.
-- 
-- An entry in the valid(1) state is fully configured and
-- consistent and fully represents the configuration or
-- operation such a row is intended to represent.  For
-- example, it could be a statistical function that is
-- configured and active, or a filter that is available
-- in the list of filters processed by the packet capture
-- process.
-- 
-- A manager is restricted to changing the state of an
-- entry in the following ways:
-- 
--                       create   under
--      To:       valid  Request  Creation  invalid
-- From:
-- valid             OK       NO        OK       OK
-- createRequest    N/A      N/A       N/A      N/A
-- underCreation     OK       NO        OK       OK
-- invalid           NO       NO        NO       OK
-- nonExistent       NO       OK        NO       OK
-- 
-- In the table above, it is not applicable to move the
-- state from the createRequest state to any other
-- state because the manager will never find the
-- variable in that state.  The nonExistent state is
-- not a value of the enumeration, rather it means that
-- the entryStatus variable does not exist at all.
-- 
-- An agent may allow an entryStatus variable to change
-- state in additional ways, so long as the semantics
-- of the states are followed.  This allowance is made
-- to ease the implementation of the agent and is made
-- despite the fact that managers should never
-- excercise these additional state transitions.

--   The sleEvent Group
-- Implementation of the Event group is optional.
-- 
-- The Event group controls the generation and notification
-- of events from this device.  Each entry in the eventTable
-- describes the parameters of the event that can be
-- triggered. Each event entry is fired by an associated
-- condition located elsewhere in the MIB.  An event entry
-- may also be associated- with a function elsewhere in the
-- MIB that will be executed when the event is generated.  For
-- example, a channel may be turned on or off by the firing
-- of an event.
-- 
-- Each eventEntry may optionally specify that a log entry
-- be created on its behalf whenever the event occurs.
-- Each entry may also specify that notification should
-- occur by way of SNMP trap messages.  In this case, the
-- community for the trap message is given in the associated
-- eventCommunity object.  The enterprise and specific trap
-- fields of the trap are determined by the condition that
-- triggered the event.  Two traps are defined: risingAlarm
-- and fallingAlarm.  If the eventTable is triggered by a
-- condition specified elsewhere, the enterprise and
-- specific trap fields must be specified for traps
-- generated for that condition.

			DESCRIPTION
				"The best estimate of the total number of collisions
				on this Ethernet segment.
				 	
				The value returned will depend on the location of
				the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and
				section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3
				states that a station must detect a collision, in
				the receive mode, if three or more stations are
				transmitting simultaneously.  A repeater port must
				detect a collision when two or more stations are
				transmitting simultaneously.  Thus a probe placed on
				a repeater port could record more collisions than a
				probe connected to a station on the same segment
				would.
				 	
				Probe location plays a much smaller role when 
				considering 10BASE-T.  14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE
				standard 802.3 defines a collision as the
				simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD
				circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same
				time).  A 10BASE-T station can only detect
				collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes
				placed on a station and a repeater, should report
				the same number of collisions.
				 	
				Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater
				should ideally report collisions between the
				repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit
				collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver
				collisions observed on any coax segments to which
				the repeater is connected.
