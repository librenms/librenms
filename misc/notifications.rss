    <title>Alerting packet loss macro</title>
    <description>The packet loss macros were broken recently. The quick fix is to have them resemble device up/down, which is similar to how they would function if fping_options.count=1. Hopefully, they can be fixed in the future, but be aware their functionality is degraded in the meantime.</description>
