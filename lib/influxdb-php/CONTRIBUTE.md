## Guidelines

In order for your pull requests to get accepted we hold all the code to the following criteria:

* PSR-1/PSR-2 compliant
* Do not use left hand conditions such as false == $something
* New features need to be documented
* Breaking changes should be well highlighted and explained in the PR
* Only short-array syntax should be used for arrays
* Use regular string concatenation for single-variable strings, and sprintf for multi-variable strings
* Do not align variable assignments

The following is optional but encouraged:

* Code should be documented
* Code should be unit tested
* Do not write conditions like false === $something, rather $something === false.
