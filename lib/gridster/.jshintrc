    // ENFORCING OPTIONS
    // These options tell JSHint to be more strict towards your code. Use them if
    // you want to allow only a safe subset of JavaScript—very useful when your
    // codebase is shared with a big number of developers with different skill
    // levels.

    // ENVIRONMENTS
    // These options pre-define global variables that are exposed by popular

    // Essentially they are shortcuts for explicit declarations like
    // /*global $:false, jQuery:false */

    // be improved in any way and might be removed at any point.
