## Configure and Start PHP-FPM

Ensure date.timezone is set in php.ini to your preferred time zone.
See <http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php> for a list of supported
timezones.  Valid examples are: "America/New_York",
"Australia/Brisbane", "Etc/UTC".
Please remember to set the system timezone as well.

```bash
vi /etc/php/7.2/fpm/php.ini
vi /etc/php/7.2/cli/php.ini
```

```bash
systemctl restart php7.2-fpm
´´´

```
timedatectl set-timezone Etc/UTC
´´´

## Configure NGINX

```bash
vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/librenms.conf
```

Add the following config, edit `server_name` as required:

```nginx
server {
 listen      80;
 server_name librenms.example.com;
 root        /opt/librenms/html;
 index       index.php;

 charset utf-8;
 gzip on;
 gzip_types text/css application/javascript text/javascript application/x-javascript image/svg+xml text/plain text/xsd text/xsl text/xml image/x-icon;
 location / {
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
 }
 location /api/v0 {
  try_files $uri $uri/ /api_v0.php?$query_string;
 }
 location ~ \.php {
  include fastcgi.conf;
  fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
  fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.2-fpm.sock;
 }
 location ~ /\.ht {
  deny all;
 }
}
```

```bash
rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
systemctl restart nginx
```

# Configure snmpd

```bash
cp /opt/librenms/snmpd.conf.example /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf
vi /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf
```

Edit the text which says `RANDOMSTRINGGOESHERE` and set your own community string.

```bash
curl -o /usr/bin/distro https://raw.githubusercontent.com/librenms/librenms-agent/master/snmp/distro
chmod +x /usr/bin/distro
systemctl restart snmpd
```

# Cron job

```bash
cp /opt/librenms/librenms.nonroot.cron /etc/cron.d/librenms
```

> NOTE: Keep in mind  that cron, by default, only uses a very limited
> set of environment variables. You may need to configure proxy
> variables for the cron invocation. Alternatively adding the proxy
> settings in config.php is possible too. The config.php file will be
> created in the upcoming steps. Review the following URL after you
> finished librenms install steps:
> <https://docs.librenms.org/Support/Configuration/#proxy-support>

# Copy logrotate config

LibreNMS keeps logs in `/opt/librenms/logs`. Over time these can
become large and be rotated out.  To rotate out the old logs you can
use the provided logrotate config file:

```bash
cp /opt/librenms/misc/librenms.logrotate /etc/logrotate.d/librenms
```

# Set permissions

```bash
chown -R librenms:librenms /opt/librenms
setfacl -d -m g::rwx /opt/librenms/rrd /opt/librenms/logs /opt/librenms/bootstrap/cache/ /opt/librenms/storage/
setfacl -R -m g::rwx /opt/librenms/rrd /opt/librenms/logs /opt/librenms/bootstrap/cache/ /opt/librenms/storage/
```

# Web installer

Now head to the web installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

<http://librenms.example.com/install.php>

The web installer might prompt you to create a `config.php` file in
your librenms install location manually, copying the content displayed
on-screen to the file. If you have to do this, please remember to set
the permissions on config.php after you copied the on-screen contents
to the file. Run:

```bash
chown librenms:librenms /opt/librenms/config.php
```

# Final steps

That's it!  You now should be able to log in to
<http://librenms.example.com/>.  Please note that we have not covered
HTTPS setup in this example, so your LibreNMS install is not secure by
default.  Please do not expose it to the public Internet unless you
have configured HTTPS and taken appropriate web server hardening
steps.

# Add the first device

We now suggest that you add localhost as your first device from within
the WebUI.

# Troubleshooting

If you ever have issues with your install, run validate.php as root in
the librenms directory:

```bash
cd /opt/librenms
./validate.php
```

There are various options for getting help listed on the LibreNMS web
site: <https://www.librenms.org/#support>

# What next?

Now that you've installed LibreNMS, we'd suggest that you have a read
of a few other docs to get you going:
