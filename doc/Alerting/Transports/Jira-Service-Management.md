## Jira Service Management

Using Jira Service Management LibreNMS integration, LibreNMS forwards alerts to
Jira Service Management with detailed information. Jira Service Management acts as a dispatcher for
LibreNMS alerts, determines the right people to notify based on
on-call schedules and notifies via email, text messages (SMS), phone
calls and iOS & Android push notifications. Then escalates alerts
until the alert is acknowledged or closed.

:warning: If the feature isn’t available on your site, keep checking Jira Service Management for updates.
