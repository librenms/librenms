## Cisco Spark (aka Webex Teams)

Cisco Spark (now known as Webex Teams). LibreNMS can send alerts to a Cisco
Spark room. To make this possible you need to have a RoomID and a token.
You can also choose to send alerts using Markdown syntax.  Enabling this
option provides for more richly formatted alerts, but be sure to adjust your
alert template to account for the Markdown syntax.
