## Telegram

> Thank you to [snis](https://github.com/snis) for these instructions.

1. First you must create a telegram account and add BotFather to you
   list. To do this click on the following url:
   [https://telegram.me/botfather](https://telegram.me/botfather)

1. Generate a new bot with the command "/newbot" BotFather is then
   asking for a username and a normal name. After that your bot is
   created and you get a HTTP token. (for more options for your bot
   type "/help")

1. Add your bot to telegram with the following url:
   `http://telegram.me/<botname>` to use app or
   `https://web.telegram.org/<botname>` to use in web, and send some
   text to the bot.

1. The BotFather should have responded with a token, copy your token
   code and go to the following page in chrome:
   `https://api.telegram.org/bot<tokencode>/getUpdates` (this could
   take a while so continue to refresh until you see something similar
   to below)

1. You see a json code with the message you sent to the bot. Copy the
   Chat id. In this example that is “-9787468” within this example:
   `"message":{"message_id":7,"from":"id":656556,"first_name":"Joo","last_name":"Doo","username":"JohnDoo"},"chat":{"id":-9787468,"title":"Telegram
   Group"},"date":1435216924,"text":"Hi"}}]}`.

1. Now create a new "Telegram transport" in LibreNMS (Global Settings
   -> Alerting Settings -> Telegram transport). Click on 'Add Telegram
   config' and put your chat id and token into the relevant box.

1. If want to use a group to receive alerts, you need to pick the Chat
   ID of the group chat, and not of the Bot itself.
