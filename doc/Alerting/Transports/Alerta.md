## Alerta

The [alerta](https://alerta.io) monitoring system is a tool used to
consolidate and de-duplicate alerts from multiple sources for quick
‘at-a-glance’ visualisation. With just one system you can monitor
alerts from many other monitoring tools on a single screen.

**Example:**

| ------ | ------- |
| API Endpoint   | http://alerta.example.com/api/alert |
| Environment | Production |
