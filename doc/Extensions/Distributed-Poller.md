# Distributed Poller

A normal install contains all parts of LibreNMS:
 - Poller/Discovery/etc workers
 - RRD (Time series data store) *
 - Database *
 - Webserver (Web UI/API) *
 
\* may only be installed on one server (however, some can be clustered)

Distributed Polling allows the workers to be spread across additional 
servers for horizontal scaling. Distributed polling is not intended for
remote polling.

Devices can be grouped together into a `poller_group` to pin these
devices to a single or a group of designated pollers.

All pollers need to write to the same set of RRD files, preferably via
RRDcached.

It is a requirement that all pollers can access the central memcached
to communicate with each other.

# Requirements

These requirements are above the normal requirements for a full LibreNMS install.

- rrdtool version 1.4 or above
- Python 3 python-memcached package
- a memcached install
- a rrdcached install

By default, all hosts are shared and have the `poller_group = 0`. To
pin a device to a poller, set it to a value greater than 0 and set the
same value in the poller's config with
`$config['distributed_poller_group']`. One can also specify a comma
separated string of poller groups in
$config['distributed_poller_group'].  The poller will then poll
devices from any of the groups listed.  If new devices get added from
the poller they will be assigned to the first poller group in the list
unless the group is specified when adding the device.

A standard configuration for a distributed poller would look like:

```php
// Distributed Poller-Settings
$config['distributed_poller']                            = true;
// optional: defaults to hostname
#$config['distributed_poller_name']                      = 'custom';
$config['distributed_poller_group']                      = 0;
$config['distributed_poller_memcached_host']             = 'example.net';
$config['distributed_poller_memcached_port']             = '11211';
```

## Example Setup

Below is an example setup based on a real deployment which at the time
of writing covers over 2,500 devices and 50,000 ports. The setup is
running within an OpenStack environment with some commodity hardware
for remote pollers. Here's a diagram of how you can scale LibreNMS
out:

![Example Setup](http://docs.librenms.org/img/librenms-distributed-diagram.png)

## Architecture

How you setup the distribution is entirely up to you, you can choose
to host the majority of the required services on a single virtual
machine or server and then a poller to actually query the devices
being monitored all the way through to having a dedicated server for
each of the individual roles. Below are notes on what you need to
consider both from the software layer but also connectivity.

### Web / API Layer

This is typically Apache but we have setup guides for both Nginx and
Lighttpd which should work perfectly fine. There is nothing unique
about the role this service is providing except that if you are adding
devices from this layer then the web service will need to be able to
connect to the end device via SNMP and perform an ICMP test.

It is advisable to run RRDCached within this setup so that you don't
need to share the rrd folder via a remote file share such as NFS. The
web service can then generate rrd graphs via RRDCached. If RRDCached
isn't an option then you can mount the rrd directory to read the RRD
files directly.

### Database Server

MySQL / MariaDB - At the moment these are the only database servers
that are supported.

The pollers, web and API layers should all be able to access the
database server directly.

### RRD Storage

Central storage should be provided so all RRD files can be read from
and written to in one location. As suggested above, it's recommended
that RRD Cached is configured and used.

For this example, we are running RRDCached to allow all pollers and
web/api servers to read/write to the rrd files with the rrd directory
also exported by NFS for simple access and maintenance.

### Memcache

Memcache is required for the distributed pollers to be able to
register to a central location and record what devices are
polled. Memcache can run from any of the servers so long as it is
accessible by all pollers.

### Pollers

Pollers can be installed and run from anywhere, the only requirements are:

- They can access the Memcache instance
- They can create RRD files via some method such as a shared
  filesystem or RRDTool >=1.5.5
- They can access the MySQL server

You can either assign pollers into groups and set a poller group
against certain devices, this will mean that those devices will only
be processed by certain pollers (default poller group is 0) or you can
assign all pollers to the default poller group for them to process any
and all devices.

This will provide the ability to have a single poller behind a NAT
firewall monitor internal devices and report back to your central
system. You will then be able to monitor those devices from the Web UI
as normal.

Another benefit to this is that you can provide N+x pollers, i.e if
you know that you require three pollers to process all devices within
300 seconds then adding a 4th poller will mean that should any one
single poller fail then the remaining three will complete polling in
time. You could also use this to take a poller out of service for
maintenance, i.e OS updates and software updates.

It is extremely advisable to either run a central recursive dns server
such as pdns-recursor and have all of your pollers use this or install
a recursive dns server on each poller - the volume of DNS requests on
large installs can be significant and will slow polling down enough to
cause issues with a large number of devices.

A last note to make sure of, is that all pollers writing to the same DB
need to have the same `APP_KEY` value set in the `.env` file.

### Discovery

It's not necessary to run discovery services on all pollers. In fact,
you should only run one discovery process per poller group. Designate
a single poller to run discovery (or a separate server if required).

### Configuration

Settings in config.php should be copied to all servers as they only apply locally.

One way around this is to set settings in the database via the web ui or `./lnms config:set`

### Config sample

The following config is taken from a live setup which consists of a
Web server, DB server, RRDCached server and 3 pollers.

Web Server:
