# About

The Component extension provides a generic database storage mechanism
for discovery and poller modules. The Driver behind this extension was
to provide the features of ports, in a generic manner to
discovery/poller modules.

It provides a status (Nagios convention), the ability to Disable (do
not poll), or Ignore (do not Alert).

## Database Structure

The database structure contains the component table:

```SQL
mysql> select * from component limit 1;
+----+-----------+------+------------+--------+----------+--------+-------+
| id | device_id | type | label      | status | disabled | ignore | error |
+----+-----------+------+------------+--------+----------+--------+-------+
|  9 |         1 | TEST | TEST LABEL |      0 |        1 |      1 |       |
+----+-----------+------+------------+--------+----------+--------+-------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

These fields are described below:

- `id` - ID for each component, unique index
- `device_id` - device_id from the devices table
- `type` - name from the component_type table
- `label` - Display label for the component
- `status` - The status of the component, retrieved from the device
- `disabled` - Should this component be polled?
- `ignore` - Should this component be alerted on
- `error` - Error message if in Alert state

The component_prefs table holds custom data in an Attribute/Value format:

```sql
mysql> select * from component_prefs limit 1;
+----+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| id | component | attribute | value     |
+----+-----------+-----------+-----------+
|  4 |         9 | TEST_ATTR | TEST_ATTR |
+----+-----------+-----------+-----------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

### Reserved Fields

When this data from both the `component` and `component_prefs` tables
is returned in one single consolidated array, there is the potential
for someone to attempt to set an attribute (in the `component_prefs`)
table that is used in the `component` table. Because of this all
fields of the `component` table are reserved, they cannot be used as
custom attributes, if you update these the module will attempt to
write them to the `component` table, not the `component_prefs` table.

## Using Components

Create an instance of the component class:

```php
$COMPONENT = new LibreNMS\Component();
```

### Retrieving Components

Now you can retrieve an array of the available components:

```php
$ARRAY = $COMPONENT->getComponents($DEVICE_ID, $OPTIONS);
```

`getComponents` takes 2 arguments:

- `DEVICE_ID` or null for all devices.
- `OPTIONS` - an array of various options.

`getComponents` will return an array containing components in the following format:

```php
Array
(
    [X] => Array
    (
        [Y1] => Array
        (
            [device_id] => 1
            [TEST_ATTR] => TEST_ATTR
            [type] => TEST
            [label] => TEST LABEL
            [status] => 0
            [ignore] => 1
            [disabled] => 1
            [error] =>
        ),
        [Y2] => Array
        (
            [device_id] => 1
            [TEST_ATTR] => TEST_ATTR
            [type] => TESTING
            [label] => TEST LABEL
            [status] => 0
            [ignore] => 1
            [disabled] => 0
            [error] =>
        ),
    )
)
```

Where X is the Device ID and Y1/Y2 is the Component ID. In the example
above, `TEST_ATTR` is a custom field, the rest are reserved fields.

### Options

Options can be supplied to `getComponents` to influence which and how
components are returned.

#### Filtering

You can filter on any of the [reserved](#reserved) fields. Filters are
created in the following format:

```php
$options['filter']['FIELD'] = array ('OPERATOR', 'CRITERIA');
```

Where:

- `FIELD` - The [reserved](#reserved) field to filter on
- `OPERATOR` - 'LIKE' or '=', are we checking if the FIELD equals or
  contains the CRITERIA.
- `CRITERIA` - The criteria to search on

There are 2 filtering shortcuts:

`$DEVICE_ID` is a synonym for:

```php
$OPTIONS['filter']['device_id'] = array ('=', $DEVICE_ID);
```

`$OPTIONS['type'] = $TYPE` is a synonym for:

```php
$OPTIONS['filter']['type'] = array ('=', $TYPE);
```

#### Sorting

You can sort the records that are returned by specifying the following option:

```php
$OPTIONS['sort'][FIELD] = 'DIRECTION';
```

Where Direction is one of:

- `ASC` - Ascending, from Low to High
- `DESC` - Descending, from High to Low

## Creating Components

To create a new component, run the `createComponent` function.

```php
$ARRAY = $COMPONENT->createComponent($DEVICE_ID, $TYPE);
```

`createComponent` takes 2 arguments:

- `DEVICE_ID` - The ID of the device to attach the component to.
- `TYPE` - The unique type for your module.

This will return a new, empty array with a component ID and Type set,
all other fields will be set to defaults.

```php
Array
(
    [1] => Array
    (
        [type] => TESTING
        [label] =>
        [status] => 1
        [ignore] => 0
        [disabled] => 0
        [error] =>
    )
)
```

## Deleting Components

When a component is no longer needed, it can be deleted.

```php
$COMPONENT->deleteComponent($COMPONENT_ID)
```

This will return `True` on success or `False` on failure.

## Editing Components

To edit a component, the procedure is:

1. [Get the Current Components](#get)
1. [Edit the array](#update-edit)
1. [Write the components](#update-write)

### Edit the Array

Once you have a component array from `getComponents` the first thing
to do is extract the components for only the single device you are
editing. This is required because the `setComponentPrefs` function
only saves a single device at a time.

```php
$ARRAY = $COMPONENT->getComponents($DEVICE_ID, $OPTIONS);
$ARRAY = $ARRAY[$DEVICE_ID];
```

Then simply edit this array to suit your needs.
If you need to add a new Attribute/Value pair you can:

```php
$ARRAY[COMPONENT_ID]['New Attribute'] = "Value";
```

If you need to delete a previously set Attribute/Value pair you can:

```php
unset($ARRAY[COMPONENT_ID]['New Attribute']);
```

If you need to edit a previously set Attribute/Value pair you can:

```php
$ARRAY[COMPONENT_ID]['Existing Attribute'] = "New Value";
```

### Write the components

To write component changes back to the database simply:

```php
$COMPONENT->setComponentPrefs($DEVICE_ID, $ARRAY)
```

When writing the component array there are several caveats to be aware
of, these are:

- `$ARRAY` must be in the format of a single device ID -
  `$ARRAY[$COMPONENT_ID][Attribute] = 'Value';` NOT in the multi
  device format returned by `getComponents` -
  `$ARRAY[$DEVICE_ID][$COMPONENT_ID][Attribute] = 'Value';`
- You cannot edit the Component ID or the Device ID
- [reserved](#reserved) fields can not be removed
- if a change is found an entry will be written to the eventlog.

## API

Component details are available via the API.
Please see the [API-Docs](/API/#function-get_components) for details.

## Alerting

It is intended that discovery/poller modules will detect the status of
a component during the polling cycle. Status is logged using the
Nagios convention for status codes, where:

```
0 = Ok,
1 = Warning,
2 = Critical
```

If you are creating a poller module which can detect a fault condition
simply set STATUS to something other than 0 and ERROR to a message
that indicates the problem.

To actually raise an alert, the user will need to create an alert
rule. To assist with this several Alerting Macro's have been created:

- `%macro.component_normal` - A component that is not disabled or
  ignored and in a Normal state.
- `%macro.component_warning` - A component that is not disabled or
  ignored and NOT in a Warning state.
- `%macro.component_critical` - A component that is not disabled or
  ignored and NOT in a Critical state.

To raise alerts for components, the following rules could be created:

- `%macros.component_critical = "1"` - To alert on all Critical
  components
- `%macros.component_critical = "1" && %component.type = "<Type of
  Component>"` - To alert on all Critical components of a particular
  type.

If there is a particular component you would like excluded from
alerting, simply set the ignore field to 1.

The data that is written to each alert when it is raised is in the following format:

`COMPONENT_TYPE - LABEL - ERROR`
