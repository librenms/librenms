# Introduction

You can use Application support to graph performance statistics of
many applications.

Different applications support a variety of ways to collect data: 1)
by direct connection to the application, 2) snmpd extend, or 3) [the
agent](Agent-Setup.md). The monitoring of applications could be added
before or after the hosts have been added to LibreNMS.

If multiple methods of collection are listed you only need to enable one.

## SNMP Extend

When using the snmp extend method, the application discovery module
will pick up which applications you have set up for monitoring
automatically, even if the device is already in LibreNMS. The
application discovery module is enabled by default for most \*nix
operating systems, but in some cases you will need to manually enable
the application discovery module.

### SUDO

One major thing to keep in mind when using SNMP extend is these run as the snmpd
user that can be an unprivileged user. In these situations you need to use sudo.

To test if you need sudo, first check the user snmpd is running as.
Then test if you can run the extend script as that user without issue.
For example if snmpd is running as 'Debian-snmp' and we want
to run the extend for proxmox, we check that the following run without error:

```
sudo -u Debian-snmp /usr/local/bin/proxmox
```

If it doesn't work, then you will need to use sudo with the extend command.
For the example above, that would mean adding the line below to the sudoers file:

```
Debian-snmp ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/proxmox
```

Finally we would need to add sudo to the extend command, which would look
like that for proxmox:

```
extend proxmox /usr/bin/sudo /usr/local/bin/proxmox
```

## Enable the application discovery module

1. Edit the device for which you want to add this support
1. Click on the *Modules* tab and enable the `applications` module.
1. This will be automatically saved, and you should get a green
   confirmation pop-up message.

![Enable-application-module](/img/Enable_application_module.png)

After you have enabled the application module, it would be wise to
then also enable which applications you want to monitor, in the rare
case where LibreNMS does not automatically detect it.

**Note**: Only do this if an application was not auto-discovered by
LibreNMS during discovery and polling.

## Enable the application(s) to be discovered

1. Go to the device you have just enabled the application module for.
1. Click on the *Applications* tab and select the applications you
   want to monitor.
1. This will also be automatically saved, and you should get a green
   confirmation pop-up message.

## Agent

The unix-agent does not have a discovery module, only a poller
module. That poller module is always disabled by default. It needs to
be manually enabled if using the agent. Some applications will be
automatically enabled by the unix-agent poller module. It is better to
ensure that your application is enabled for monitoring. You can check

# Apache

Either use SNMP extend or use the agent.

Note that you need to install and configure the Apache
[mod_status](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/mod/mod_status.html)
module before trying the script.

## SNMP Extend

1: Download the script onto the desired host (the host must be added
to LibreNMS devices)

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/librenms/librenms-agent/master/snmp/apache-stats.py -O /etc/snmp/apache-stats.py
```

2: Make the script executable (chmod +x /etc/snmp/apache-stats.py)

3: Create the cache directory, '/var/cache/librenms/' and make sure
that it is owned by the user running the SNMP daemon.

```
mkdir -p /var/cache/librenms/
```

4: Verify it is working by running /etc/snmp/apache-stats.py Package `urllib3` for python3 needs to be
installed. In Debian-based systems for example you can achieve this by issuing:

```
apt-get install python3-urllib3
```

5: Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf) and add:

```
extend apache /etc/snmp/apache-stats.py
```

6: Restart snmpd on your host

7: Test by running

```
snmpwalk <various options depending on your setup> localhost NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendOutput2Table
```

## Agent

[Install the agent](Agent-Setup.md) on this device if it isn't already
and copy the `apache` script to `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/`

1: Verify it is working by running /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/apache
(If you get error like "Can't locate LWP/Simple.pm". libwww-perl needs
to be installed: apt-get install libwww-perl)

2: Create the cache directory, '/var/cache/librenms/' and make sure
that it is owned by the user running the SNMP daemon.

```
mkdir -p /var/cache/librenms/
```

3: On the device page in Librenms, edit your host and check the
`Apache` under the Applications tab.

# Asterisk

A small shell script that reports various Asterisk call status.

## SNMP Extend

1: Download the [asterisk
script](https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/blob/master/snmp/asterisk)
to `/etc/snmp/` on your asterisk server.
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/librenms/librenms-agent/master/snmp/asterisk -O /etc/snmp/asterisk
```

2: Run `chmod +x /etc/snmp/asterisk`

3: Configure `ASCLI` in the script.

4: Verify it is working by running `/etc/snmp/asterisk`

5: Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf`) and add:

```
extend asterisk /etc/snmp/asterisk
```

6: Restart snmpd on your host

The application should be auto-discovered as described at the top of
the page. If it is not, please follow the steps set out under `SNMP
Extend` heading top of page.

# backupninja

A small shell script that reports status of last backupninja backup.

## SNMP Extend

1: Download the [backupninja
script](https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/blob/master/snmp/backupninja.py)
to `/etc/snmp/backupninja.py` on your backuped server.
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/librenms/librenms-agent/master/snmp/backupninja.py -O /etc/snmp/backupninja.py`
```
2: Make the script executable: `chmod +x /etc/snmp/backupninja.py`
3: Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf`) and add:

```
extend backupninja /etc/snmp/backupninja.py
```

4: Restart snmpd on your host


# BIND9 aka named

1: Create stats file with appropriate permissions:

```bash
~$ touch /var/cache/bind/stats
~$ chown bind:bind /var/cache/bind/stats
```

Change `user:group` to the user and group that's running bind/named.

2: Bind/named configuration:

```text
options {
    ...
    statistics-file "/var/cache/bind/stats";
    zone-statistics yes;
    ...
};
```

3: Restart your bind9/named after changing the configuration.

4: Verify that everything works by executing `rndc stats && cat
/var/cache/bind/stats`. In case you get a `Permission Denied` error,
make sure you changed the ownership correctly.

5: Also be aware that this file is appended to each time `rndc stats`
is called. Given this it is suggested you setup file rotation for
it. Alternatively you can also set zero_stats to 1 in the config.

6: The script for this also requires the Perl module
`File::ReadBackwards`.

```
FreeBSD       => p5-File-ReadBackwards
CentOS/RedHat => perl-File-ReadBackwards
Debian/Ubuntu => libfile-readbackwards-perl
```

If it is not available, it can be installed by `cpan -i File::ReadBackwards`.

7: You may possibly need to configure the agent/extend script as well.

The config file's path defaults to the same path as the script, but
with .config appended. So if the script is located at
`/etc/snmp/bind`, the config file will be
`/etc/snmp/bind.config`. Alternatively you can also specify a config
via `-c $file`.

Anything starting with a # is comment. The format for variables are
$variable=$value. Empty lines are ignored. Spaces and tabs at either
the start or end of a line are ignored.

Content of an example /etc/snmp/bind.config . Please edit with your
own settings.

```
rndc = The path to rndc. Default: /usr/bin/env rndc
call_rndc = A 0/1 boolean on whether or not to call rndc stats.
    Suggest to set to 0 if using netdata. Default: 1
stats_file = The path to the named stats file. Default: /var/cache/bind/stats
agent = A 0/1 boolean for if this is being used as a LibreNMS
    agent or not. Default: 0
zero_stats = A 0/1 boolean for if the stats file should be zeroed
    first. Default: 0 (1 if guessed)
```

If you want to guess at the configuration, call the script with `-g`
and it will print out what it thinks it should be.

## SNMP Extend

1: Copy the bind shell script, to the desired host.

```
wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/bind -O /etc/snmp/bind
```

2: Make the script executable

```

If you want to use the cache and update it if needed, this can by
using the -c and -U switches.

```
extend fail2ban /etc/snmp/fail2ban -c -U
```

If you need to specify a custom location for the fail2ban-client, that
can be done via the -f switch.

If not specified, "/usr/bin/env fail2ban-client" is used.

```
extend fail2ban /etc/snmp/fail2ban -f /foo/bin/fail2ban-client
```

5: Restart snmpd on your host

restart cron.

```
*/3    *    *    *    *    root    /etc/snmp/fail2ban -u
```

7: Restart or reload cron on your system.

If you have more than a few jails configured, you may need to use
caching as each jail needs to be polled and fail2ban-client can't do
so in a timely manner for than a few. This can result in failure of
other SNMP information being polled.

For additional details of the switches, please see the POD in the
script it self at the top.

# Munin

## Agent

1. Install the script to your agent: `wget
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/librenms/librenms-agent/master/agent-local/munin
   -O /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/munin`
1. Make the script executable (`chmod +x
   /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/munin`)
1. Create the munin scripts dir: `mkdir -p
   /usr/share/munin/munin-scripts`
1. Install your munin scripts into the above directory.

To create your own custom munin scripts, please see this example:

```
#!/bin/bash
if [ "$1" = "config" ]; then
    echo 'graph_title Some title'
    echo 'graph_args --base 1000 -l 0' #not required
    echo 'graph_vlabel Some label'
    echo 'graph_scale no' #not required, can be yes/no
    echo 'graph_category system' #Choose something meaningful, can be anything
    echo 'graph_info This graph shows something awesome.' #Short desc
    echo 'foobar.label Label for your unit' # Repeat these two lines as much as you like
    echo 'foobar.info Desc for your unit.'
    exit 0
fi
echo -n "foobar.value " $(date +%s) #Populate a value, here unix-timestamp
```

# MySQL

## Agent

[Install the agent](Agent-Setup.md) on this device if it isn't already
and copy the `mysql` script to `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/`

Create the cache directory, '/var/cache/librenms/' and make sure
that it is owned by the user running the SNMP daemon.

```
mkdir -p /var/cache/librenms/
```

The MySQL script requires PHP-CLI and the PHP MySQL extension, so
please verify those are installed.

CentOS (May vary based on PHP version)

```
yum install php-cli php-mysql
```

Debian (May vary based on PHP version)

```
apt-get install php5-cli php5-mysql
```

Unlike most other scripts, the MySQL script requires a configuration
file `mysql.cnf` in the same directory as the extend or agent script
with following content:

```php
<?php
$mysql_user = 'root';
$mysql_pass = 'toor';
$mysql_host = 'localhost';
$mysql_port = 3306;
```

Verify it is working by running `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/mysql`

## SNMP extend

1: Copy the mysql script to the desired host. `wget
https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/mysql -O /etc/snmp/mysql `

2: Run `chmod +x /etc/snmp/mysql`

3: Create the cache directory, '/var/cache/librenms/' and make sure
that it is owned by the user running the SNMP daemon.

```
mkdir -p /var/cache/librenms/
```

4: Unlike most other scripts, the MySQL script requires a
configuration file `mysql.cnf` in `/etc/snmp/` with following content:

```php
<?php
$mysql_user = 'root';
$mysql_pass = 'toor';
$mysql_host = 'localhost';
$mysql_port = 3306;
```

Note that depending on your MySQL installation (chrooted install for example),
you may have to specify 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost. Localhost make
a MySQL connection via the mysql socket, while 127.0.0.1 make a standard
IP connection to mysql.

5: Edit your snmpd.conf file and add:

```
extend mysql /etc/snmp/mysql
```

6: Install the PHP CLI language and your MySQL module of choice for
PHP.

that snmpd can write too. This file is used for tracking changes
between various values between each time it is called by snmpd. Also
make sure the path for pflogsumm is correct.

8: Run /etc/snmp/postfixdetailed to create the initial cache file so
you don't end up with some crazy initial starting value. Please note
that each time /etc/snmp/postfixdetailed is ran, the cache file is
updated, so if this happens in between LibreNMS doing it then the
values will be thrown off for that polling period.

The application should be auto-discovered as described at the top of
the page. If it is not, please follow the steps set out under `SNMP

# SMART

## SNMP Extend

1. Copy the Perl script, smart, to the desired host.

```wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/smart -O /etc/snmp/smart```

2. Run `chmod +x /etc/snmp/smart`

3. Edit your snmpd.conf file and add:

```
extend smart /etc/snmp/smart
```

4. You will also need to create the config file, which defaults to the same path as the script,
but with .config appended. So if the script is located at /etc/snmp/smart, the config file
will be `/etc/snmp/smart.config`. Alternatively you can also specific a config via `-c`.

Anything starting with a # is comment. The format for variables is $variable=$value. Empty
lines are ignored. Spaces and tabes at either the start or end of a line are ignored. Any
line with out a matched variable or # are treated as a disk.

```
#This is a comment
cache=/var/cache/smart
smartctl=/usr/bin/env smartctl
useSN=1
ada0
ada1
da5 /dev/da5 -d sat
twl0,0 /dev/twl0 -d 3ware,0
twl0,1 /dev/twl0 -d 3ware,1
twl0,2 /dev/twl0 -d 3ware,2
```

The variables are as below.

```
cache = The path to the cache file to use. Default: /var/cache/smart
smartctl = The path to use for smartctl. Default: /usr/bin/env smartctl
useSN = If set to 1, it will use the disks SN for reporting instead of the device name.
        1 is the default. 0 will use the device name.
```

A disk line is can be as simple as just a disk name under /dev/. Such as in the config above
The line "ada0" would resolve to "/dev/ada0" and would be called with no special argument. If
a line has a space in it, everything before the space is treated as the disk name and is what
used for reporting and everything after that is used as the argument to be passed to smartctl.

If you want to guess at the configuration, call it with -g and it will print out what it thinks
it should be.

5. Restart snmpd on your host

If you have a large number of more than one or two disks on a system,
you should consider adding this to cron. Also make sure the cache file
is some place it can be written to.

```
 */3 * * * * /etc/snmp/smart -u
```

6. If your snmp agent runs as user "snmp", edit your sudo users
   (usually `visudo`) and add at the bottom:

```
snmp ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /etc/snmp/smart, /usr/bin/env smartctl

```

and modify your snmpd.conf file accordingly:

```
extend smart /usr/bin/sudo /etc/snmp/smart
```

The application should be auto-discovered as described at the top of
the page. If it is not, please follow the steps set out under `SNMP
Extend` heading top of page.

If you set useSN to 1, it is worth noting that you will loose
history(not able to access it from the web interface) for that device
each time you change it. You will also need to run camcontrol or the
like on said server to figure out what device actually corresponds
with that serial number.

Also if the system you are using uses non-static device naming based
on bus information, it may be worthwhile just using the SN as the
device ID is going to be irrelevant in that case.

# Squid

## SNMP Proxy

1: Enable SNMP for Squid like below, if you have not already, and
restart it.

```
acl snmppublic snmp_community public
snmp_port 3401
snmp_access allow snmppublic localhost
snmp_access deny all
```

2: Restart squid on your host.

3: Edit your snmpd.conf file and add, making sure you have the same
community, host, and port as above:

```
proxy -v 2c -c public 127.0.0.1:3401 1.3.6.1.4.1.3495
```

For more advanced information on Squid and SNMP or setting up proxying
for net-snmp, please see the links below.

# TinyDNS aka djbdns

## Agent

[Install the agent](Agent-Setup.md) on this device if it isn't already
and copy the `tinydns` script to `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/`

_Note_: We assume that you use DJB's
[Daemontools](http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html) to start/stop
tinydns. And that your tinydns instance is located in `/service/dns`,
adjust this path if necessary.

1: Replace your _log_'s `run` file, typically located in
   `/service/dns/log/run` with:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
exec setuidgid dnslog tinystats ./main/tinystats/ multilog t n3 s250000 ./main/
```

2: Create tinystats directory and chown:

```bash
mkdir /service/dns/log/main/tinystats
chown dnslog:nofiles /service/dns/log/main/tinystats
```

3: Restart TinyDNS and Daemontools: `/etc/init.d/svscan restart`
   _Note_: Some say `svc -t /service/dns` is enough, on my install
   (Gentoo) it doesn't rehook the logging and I'm forced to restart it
   entirely.

# Unbound

Unbound configuration:

```text
# Enable extended statistics.
server:
        extended-statistics: yes
        statistics-cumulative: yes

remote-control:
        control-enable: yes
        control-interface: 127.0.0.1

```

Restart your unbound after changing the configuration, verify it is
working by running `unbound-control stats`.

## Option 1: SNMP Extend (Preferred and easiest method)

1: Copy the shell script, unbound, to the desired host. `wget
https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/unbound -O
/etc/snmp/unbound`

2: Run `chmod +x /etc/snmp/unbound`

3: Edit your snmpd.conf file and add:

```
extend unbound /etc/snmp/unbound
```

4: Restart snmpd.

The application should be auto-discovered as described at the top of
the page. If it is not, please follow the steps set out under `SNMP
Extend` heading top of page.

# Option 2: Agent

[Install the agent](#agent-setup) on this device if it isn't already
and copy the `unbound.sh` script to `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/`

# UPS-nut

A small shell script that exports nut ups status.

## SNMP Extend

1: Copy the [ups
   nut](https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/blob/master/snmp/ups-nut.sh)
   to `/etc/snmp/` on your host.

2: Make the script executable (chmod +x /etc/snmp/ups-nut.sh)

3: Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf) and add:

```
extend ups-nut /etc/snmp/ups-nut.sh
```

4: Restart snmpd on your host

The application should be auto-discovered as described at the top of
the page. If it is not, please follow the steps set out under `SNMP
Extend` heading top of page.

# UPS-apcups

A small shell script that exports apcacess ups status.

## SNMP Extend

1: Copy the [ups
   apcups](https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/blob/master/snmp/ups-apcups)
   to `/etc/snmp/` on your host.

2: Run `chmod +x /etc/snmp/ups-apcups`

3: Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf) and add:

```
extend ups-apcups /etc/snmp/ups-apcups
```

If 'apcaccess' is not in the PATH enviromental variable snmpd is
using, you may need to do something like below.

```
extend ups-apcups/usr/bin/env PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin /etc/snmp/ups-apcups
```

4: Restart snmpd on your host

The application should be auto-discovered as described at the top of
the page. If it is not, please follow the steps set out under `SNMP
Extend` heading top of page.

# SDFS info

A small shell script that exportfs SDFS volume info.

## SNMP Extend

1: Download the script onto the desired host (the host must be added
   to LibreNMS devices)

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/librenms/librenms-agent/master/snmp/sdfsinfo -O /etc/snmp/sdfsinfo
```

2: Make the script executable (chmod +x /etc/snmp/sdfsinfo)

3: Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf) and add:

```
extend sdfsinfo /etc/snmp/sdfsinfo
```

4: Restart snmpd on your host

The application should be auto-discovered as described at the top of
the page. If it is not, please follow the steps set out under `SNMP
Extend` heading top of page.

# ZFS

## SNMP Extend

`zfs-linux` requires python3 >=python3.5.

The installation steps are:

1. Copy the polling script to the desired host (the host must be added
   to LibreNMS devices)
1. Make the script executable
1. Edit snmpd.conf to include ZFS stats

### FreeBSD

```
wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/zfs-freebsd -O /etc/snmp/zfs-freebsd
chmod +x /etc/snmp/zfs-freebsd
echo "extend zfs /etc/snmp/zfs-freebsd" >> /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf
```

### Linux

```
wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/zfs-linux -O /etc/snmp/zfs-linux
chmod +x /etc/snmp/zfs-linux
echo "extend zfs sudo /etc/snmp/zfs-linux" >> /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf
```

Edit your sudo users (usually `visudo`) and add at the bottom:

```
snmp ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /etc/snmp/zfs-linux
```


Now restart snmpd and you're all set.
