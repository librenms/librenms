# Applications

You can use Application support to graph performance statistics of
many applications.

Different applications support a variety of ways to collect data: 

1. By direct connection to the application
2. snmpd extend
3. [The agent](Agent-Setup.md).

The monitoring of applications could be added
before or after the hosts have been added to LibreNMS.

If multiple methods of collection are listed you only need to enable one.

## SNMP Extend

When using the snmp extend method, the application discovery module
will pick up which applications you have set up for monitoring
automatically, even if the device is already in LibreNMS. The
application discovery module is enabled by default for most \*nix
operating systems, but in some cases you will need to manually enable
the application discovery module.

### SUDO

One major thing to keep in mind when using SNMP extend is these run as the snmpd
user that can be an unprivileged user. In these situations you need to use sudo.

To test if you need sudo, first check the user snmpd is running as.
Then test if you can run the extend script as that user without issue.
For example if snmpd is running as 'Debian-snmp' and we want
to run the extend for proxmox, we check that the following run without error:

```
sudo -u Debian-snmp /usr/local/bin/proxmox
```

If it doesn't work, then you will need to use sudo with the extend command.
For the example above, that would mean adding the line below to the sudoers file:

```
Debian-snmp ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/proxmox
```

Finally we would need to add sudo to the extend command, which would look
like that for proxmox:

```
extend proxmox /usr/bin/sudo /usr/local/bin/proxmox
```

### JSON Return Optimization Using librenms_return_optimizer

While the json_app_get does allow for more complex and larger data
to be easily returned by a extend and the data to then be worked
with, this can also sometimes result in large returns that
occasionally don't play nice with SNMP on some networks.

`librenms_return_optimizer` fixes this via taking the extend output
piped to it, gzipping it, and then converting it to base64. The
later is needed as net-snmp does not play that nice with binary data,
converting most of the non-printable characters to `.`. This does add
a bit of additional overhead to the gzipped data, but still tends to
be result in a return that is usually a third of the size for JSONs
items.

The change required is fairly simply. So for the portactivity example below...

```
extend portactivity /etc/snmp/extends/portactivity smtps,http,imap,imaps,postgresql,https,ldap,ldaps,nfsd,syslog-conn,ssh,matrix,gitea
```

Would become this...

```
extend portactivity /usr/local/bin/lnms_return_optimizer -- /etc/snmp/extends/portactivity smtps,http,imap,imaps,postgresql,https,ldap,ldaps,nfsd,syslog-conn,ssh,matrix,gitea
```

The requirements for this are Perl, MIME::Base64, and Gzip::Faster.

Installing on FreeBSD...

```
pkg install p5-MIME-Base64 p5-Gzip-Faster wget
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/librenms/librenms-agent/master/utils/librenms_return_optimizer -O /usr/local/bin/librenms_return_optimizer
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/librenms_return_optimizer
```

Installing on Debian...

```
apt-get install zlib1g-dev cpanminus wget
cpanm Gzip::Faster
cpanm MIME::Base64
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/librenms/librenms-agent/master/utils/librenms_return_optimizer -O /usr/local/bin/librenms_return_optimizer
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/librenms_return_optimizer
```

## Enable the application discovery module

1. Edit the device for which you want to add this support
1. Click on the *Modules* tab and enable the `applications` module.
1. This will be automatically saved, and you should get a green
   confirmation pop-up message.

![Enable-application-module](/img/Enable_application_module.png)

After you have enabled the application module, it would be wise to
then also enable which applications you want to monitor, in the rare
case where LibreNMS does not automatically detect it.

**Note**: Only do this if an application was not auto-discovered by
LibreNMS during discovery and polling.

## Enable the application(s) to be discovered

1. Go to the device you have just enabled the application module for.
1. Click on the *Applications* tab and select the applications you
   want to monitor.
1. This will also be automatically saved, and you should get a green
   confirmation pop-up message.

![Enable-applications](/img/Enable_applications.png)

## Agent

The unix-agent does not have a discovery module, only a poller
module. That poller module is always disabled by default. It needs to
be manually enabled if using the agent. Some applications will be
automatically enabled by the unix-agent poller module. It is better to
ensure that your application is enabled for monitoring. You can check
by following the steps under the `SNMP Extend` heading.

## Apache

Either use SNMP extend or use the agent.

Note that you need to install and configure the Apache
[mod_status](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/mod/mod_status.html)
module before trying the script.

### SNMP Extend

1. Download the script onto the desired host (the host must be added
to LibreNMS devices)
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/librenms/librenms-agent/master/snmp/apache-stats.py -O /etc/snmp/apache-stats.py
```

2. Make the script executable
```
chmod +x /etc/snmp/apache-stats.py
```

3. Create the cache directory, '/var/cache/librenms/' and make sure
that it is owned by the user running the SNMP daemon.
```
mkdir -p /var/cache/librenms/
```

4. Verify it is working by running /etc/snmp/apache-stats.py Package `urllib3` for python3 needs to be
installed. In Debian-based systems for example you can achieve this by issuing:
```
apt-get install python3-urllib3
```

5. Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf) and add:
```
extend apache /etc/snmp/apache-stats.py
```

6. Restart snmpd on your host

7. Test by running
```
snmpwalk <various options depending on your setup> localhost NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendOutput2Table
```

### Agent

[Install the agent](Agent-Setup.md) on this device if it isn't already
and copy the `apache` script to `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/`

1. Verify it is working by running /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/apache
(If you get error like "Can't locate LWP/Simple.pm". libwww-perl needs
to be installed: apt-get install libwww-perl)

2. Create the cache directory, '/var/cache/librenms/' and make sure
that it is owned by the user running the SNMP daemon.
```
mkdir -p /var/cache/librenms/
```

3. On the device page in Librenms, edit your host and check the
`Apache` under the Applications tab.

## Asterisk

A small shell script that reports various Asterisk call status.

### SNMP Extend

1. Download the [asterisk
script](https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/blob/master/snmp/asterisk)
to `/etc/snmp/` on your asterisk server.
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/librenms/librenms-agent/master/snmp/asterisk -O /etc/snmp/asterisk
```

2. Make the script executable
```
chmod +x /etc/snmp/asterisk
```

3. Configure `ASCLI` in the script.

4. Verify it is working by running `/etc/snmp/asterisk`

5. Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf`) and add:
```
extend asterisk /etc/snmp/asterisk
```

6. Restart snmpd on your host

The application should be auto-discovered as described at the top of
the page. If it is not, please follow the steps set out under `SNMP
Extend` heading top of page.

## backupninja

A small shell script that reports status of last backupninja backup.

### SNMP Extend

1. Download the [backupninja
script](https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/blob/master/snmp/backupninja.py)
to `/etc/snmp/backupninja.py` on your backuped server.
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/librenms/librenms-agent/master/snmp/backupninja.py -O /etc/snmp/backupninja.py`
```
2. Make the script executable:
```
chmod +x /etc/snmp/backupninja.py
```

3. Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf`) and add:
```
extend backupninja /etc/snmp/backupninja.py
```

4. Restart snmpd on your host


## BIND9 aka named

1. Create stats file with appropriate permissions:
```bash
touch /var/cache/bind/stats
chown bind:bind /var/cache/bind/stats
```
Change `user:group` to the user and group that's running bind/named.

2. Bind/named configuration:
```text
options {
    ...
    statistics-file "/var/cache/bind/stats";
    zone-statistics yes;
    ...
};
```

3. Restart your bind9/named after changing the configuration.

4. Verify that everything works by executing `rndc stats && cat
/var/cache/bind/stats`. In case you get a `Permission Denied` error,
make sure you changed the ownership correctly.

5. Also be aware that this file is appended to each time `rndc stats`
is called. Given this it is suggested you setup file rotation for
it. Alternatively you can also set zero_stats to 1 in the config.

6. The script for this also requires the Perl module `File::ReadBackwards`.
```
FreeBSD       => p5-File-ReadBackwards
CentOS/RedHat => perl-File-ReadBackwards
Debian/Ubuntu => libfile-readbackwards-perl
```

If it is not available, it can be installed by `cpan -i File::ReadBackwards`.

7. You may possibly need to configure the agent/extend script as well.

The config file's path defaults to the same path as the script, but
with .config appended. So if the script is located at
`/etc/snmp/bind`, the config file will be
`/etc/snmp/bind.config`. Alternatively you can also specify a config
via `-c $file`.

Anything starting with a # is comment. The format for variables are
$variable=$value. Empty lines are ignored. Spaces and tabs at either
the start or end of a line are ignored.

Content of an example /etc/snmp/bind.config . Please edit with your
own settings.

```
rndc = The path to rndc. Default: /usr/bin/env rndc
call_rndc = A 0/1 boolean on whether or not to call rndc stats.
    Suggest to set to 0 if using netdata. Default: 1
stats_file = The path to the named stats file. Default: /var/cache/bind/stats
agent = A 0/1 boolean for if this is being used as a LibreNMS
    agent or not. Default: 0
zero_stats = A 0/1 boolean for if the stats file should be zeroed
    first. Default: 0 (1 if guessed)
```

If you want to guess at the configuration, call the script with `-g`
and it will print out what it thinks it should be.

### SNMP Extend

1. Copy the bind shell script, to the desired host.
```
wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/bind -O /etc/snmp/bind
```

2. Make the script executable
```
chmod +x /etc/snmp/bind
```

3. Edit your snmpd.conf file and add:
```
extend bind /etc/snmp/bind
```

4. Restart snmpd on the host in question.

The application should be auto-discovered as described at the top of
the page. If it is not, please follow the steps set out under `SNMP
Extend` heading top of page.

### Agent

1. [Install the agent](Agent-Setup.md) on this device if it isn't
already and copy the script to `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/bind`
via `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/librenms/librenms-agent/master/snmp/bind -O /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/bind`

2. Make the script executable
```
chmod +x /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/bind
```

3. Set the variable 'agent' to '1' in the config.

## BIRD2

The BIRD Internet Routing Daemon (BGP) 

Due to the lack of SNMP support in the BIRD daemon, this application extracts all configured BGP protocols and parses it into LibreNMS.
This application supports both IPv4 and IPv6 Peer processing.

### SNMP Extend

1. Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf) and add:

```
extend bird2 '/usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/birdc -r show protocols all'
```

2.  Edit your sudo users (usually `visudo`) and add at the bottom:

```
Debian-snmp ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/birdc
```

_If your snmp daemon is running on a user that isnt `Debian-snmp` make sure that user has the correct permission to execute `birdc`_

3. Verify the time format for bird2 is defined. Otherwise `iso short
   ms` (hh:mm:ss) is the default value that will be used. Which is not
   compatible with the datetime parsing logic used to parse the output
   from the bird show command. `timeformat protocol` is the one
   important to be defibned for the bird2 app parsing logic to work.

Example starting point using Bird2 shorthand `iso long` (YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss):

```
timeformat base iso long;
timeformat log iso long;
timeformat protocol iso long;
timeformat route iso long;
```

*Timezone can be manually specified, example "%F %T %z" (YYYY-MM-DD
hh:mm:ss +11:45). See the [Bird
2 docs](https://bird.network.cz/?get_doc&v=20&f=bird-3.html) for more information*

4. Restart snmpd on your host

The application should be auto-discovered as described at the top of the page. If it is not, please follow the steps set out under `SNMP Extend` heading top of page.

## Certificate

A small python3 script that checks age and remaining validity of certificates

This script needs following packages on Debian/Ubuntu Systems:

* python3
* python3-openssl

Content of an example /etc/snmp/certificate.json . Please edit with your own settings.
```
{"domains": [
    {"fqdn": "www.mydomain.com"},
    {"fqdn": "some.otherdomain.org",
     "port": 8443},
    {"fqdn": "personal.domain.net"},
    {"fqdn": "selfsignedcert_host.domain.com",
     "cert_location": "/etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.pem"}
]
}
```
a. (Required): Key 'domains' contains a list of domains to check.
b. (Optional): You can define a port. By default it checks on port 443.
c. (Optional): You may define a certificate location for self-signed certificates.

### SNMP Extend
1. Copy the shell script to the desired host.
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/librenms/librenms-agent/master/snmp/certificate.py -O /etc/snmp/certificate.py
```

2. Make the script executable
```
chmod +x /etc/snmp/certificate.py
```

3. Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf) and add:
```

```

2. Make the script executable
```
chmod +x /etc/snmp/borgbackup
```

3. Install depends.
```
# FreeBSD
pkg p5-Config-Tiny p5-JSON p5-File-Slurp p5-MIME-Base64 p5-String-ShellQuote
# Debian
apt-get install libconfig-tiny-perl libjson-perl libfile-slurp-perl libmime-base64-perl libstring-shellquote-perl
# generic cpanm
cpanm Config::Tiny File::Slurp JSON MIME::Base64 String::ShellQuote
```

4. Set it up in cron.
```
*/5 * * * /etc/snmp/borgbackup 2> /dev/null > /dev/null
```

5. Configure it. See further down below or `/etc/snmp/borgbackup
   --help`.

6. Add the following to the SNMPD config.
```
extend borgbackup /bin/cat /var/cache/borgbackup_extend/extend_return
```

7. Restart SNMPD and wait for the device to rediscover or tell it to
   manually.

#### Config

The config file is a ini file and handled by
[Config::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/Config::Tiny).

    - mode :: single or multi, for if this is a single repo or for
            multiple repos.
        - Default :: single

    - repo :: Directory for the borg backup repo.
        - Default :: undef

    - passphrase :: Passphrase for the borg backup repo.
        - Default :: undef

    - passcommand :: Passcommand for the borg backup repo.
        - Default :: undef

For single repos all those variables are in the root section of the config,
so lets the repo is at '/backup/borg' with a passphrase of '1234abc'.

    repo=/backup/borg
    repo=1234abc

For multi, each section outside of the root represents a repo. So if
there is '/backup/borg1' with a passphrase of 'foobar' and
'/backup/derp' with a passcommand of 'pass show backup' it would be
like below.

    mode=multi

    [borg1]
    repo=/backup/borg1
    passphrase=foobar

    [derp]
    repo=/backup/derp
    passcommand=pass show backup

If 'passphrase' and 'passcommand' are both specified, then passcommand
is used.

#### Metrics

The metrics are all from `.data.totals` in the extend return.

## Fail2ban

### SNMP Extend

1. Copy the shell script, fail2ban, to the desired host.
```
wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/fail2ban -O /etc/snmp/fail2ban
```

2. Make the script executable
```
chmod +x /etc/snmp/fail2ban
```

3. Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf) and add:
```
extend fail2ban /etc/snmp/fail2ban
```

    1. If you want to use the cache, it is as below, by using the -c switch.
    ```
    extend fail2ban /etc/snmp/fail2ban -c
    ```

    2. If you want to use the cache and update it if needed, this can by using the -c and -U switches.
    ```
    extend fail2ban /etc/snmp/fail2ban -c -U
    ```

    3. If you need to specify a custom location for the fail2ban-client, that can be done via the -f switch.
    ```
    extend fail2ban /etc/snmp/fail2ban -f /foo/bin/fail2ban-client
    ```
    If not specified, "/usr/bin/env fail2ban-client" is used.

1. Restart snmpd on your host

2. If you wish to use caching, add the following to /etc/crontab and
restart cron.
```
*/3    *    *    *    *    root    /etc/snmp/fail2ban -u
```

6. Restart or reload cron on your system.

If you have more than a few jails configured, you may need to use
caching as each jail needs to be polled and fail2ban-client can't do
so in a timely manner for than a few. This can result in failure of
other SNMP information being polled.

For additional details of the switches, please see the POD in the
script it self at the top.

## FreeRADIUS

The FreeRADIUS application extension requires that status_server be
enabled in your FreeRADIUS config.  For more information see:
<https://wiki.freeradius.org/config/Status>

You should note that status requests increment the FreeRADIUS request
stats.  So LibreNMS polls will ultimately be reflected in your
stats/charts.

1. Go to your FreeRADIUS configuration directory (usually /etc/raddb
or /etc/freeradius).

2. `cd sites-enabled`

3. `ln -s ../sites-available/status status`

4. Restart FreeRADIUS.

5. You should be able to test with the radclient as follows...
```
echo "Message-Authenticator = 0x00, FreeRADIUS-Statistics-Type = 31, Response-Packet-Type = Access-Accept" | \
radclient -x localhost:18121 status adminsecret
```

Note that adminsecret is the default secret key in status_server.
Change if you've modified this.

### SNMP Extend

| Key               | Type         | Description                                                                                                                              |
|-------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| access            | hash         | A hash of access logs to monitor. The key is the reporting name while the value is the path to it.                                       |
| error             | hash         | A hash of errors logs to monitor. The key is the reporting name while the value is the path to it. Must have a matching entry in access  |
| auto              | boolean, 0/1 | If auto mode should be used or not. If not defined and .access is not defined, then it will default to 1. Other wise it is undef, false. |
| auto_dir          | string       | The dir to look for files in. Default: `/var/log/apache/`                                                                                |
| auto_end_regex    | string       | What to match files ending in. Default: `.log$`                                                                                          |
| auto_access_regex | string       | What will be prepended to the end regexp for looking for access log files. Default: `-access`                                            |
| auto_error_regex  | string       | What will be prepended to the end regexp for looking for error log files. Default: `-error`                                              |

Auto will attempt to generate a list of log files to process. Will
look under the directory specified for files matching the built
regexp. The regexp is built by joining the access/error regexps to the
end regexp. so for access it would be come `-access.log$`.

The default auto config would look like below.

```JSON
{
    "auto": 1,
    "auto_dir": "/var/log/apache/",
    "auto_end_regex": ".log$",
    "auto_access_regex": "-access",
    "auto_error_regex": "-error"
}
```

So lets say the log dir, `/some/dir` in our case, has the following files.

```
foo:80-access.log
foo:80-error.log
foo:443-access.log
foo:443-error.log
bar-access.log
```

Then the auto generated stuff would be a like below.

```JSON
{
    "access":{
        "foo:80": "/some/dir/foo:80-access.log",
        "foo:443": "/some/dir/foo:443-access.log",
        "bar": "/some/dir/bar-access.log",
    },
    "error":{
        "foo:80": "/some/dir/foo:80-error.log",
        "foo:443": "/some/dir/foo:443-error.log",
    }
}
```

A manual config would be like below. Note that only `foo` has a error
log that the size will be checked for and reported via the stat
`error_size`.

```JSON
{
    "auto": 0,
    "access":{
        "foo":"/var/log/www/foo.log",
        "bar:80":"/var/log/www/bar:80.log"
        "bar:443":"/var/log/www/bar:443.log"
    },
    "error":{
        "foo":"/var/log/www/foo-error.log"
    }
}
```

8. (Optional) If you have SELinux in Enforcing mode, you must add a module so the script can open and read the httpd log files:
```
cat << EOF > snmpd_http_access_log_combined.te
module snmp_http_access_log_combined 1.0;

require {
        type httpd_log_t;
        type snmpd_t;
        class file { open read };
}

#============= snmpd_t ==============

allow snmpd_t httpd_log_t:file { open read };

EOF
checkmodule -M -m -o snmpd_http_access_log_combined.mod snmpd_http_access_log_combined.te
semodule_package -o snmpd_http_access_log_combined.pp -m snmpd_http_access_log_combined.mod
semodule -i snmpd_http_access_log_combined.pp
```

## HV Monitor

HV Monitor provides a generic way to monitor hypervisors. Currently
CBSD+bhyve on FreeBSD and Libvirt+QEMU on Linux are support.

For more information see
HV::Monitor on
[Github](https://github.com/VVelox/HV-Monitor)
or [MetaCPAN](https://metacpan.org/dist/HV-Monitor).

### SNMP Extend

1. Install the SNMP Extend.

For Debian based systems this is as below.

```
# Debian
apt-get install libjson-perl libmime-base64-perl cpanminus

cpanm HV::Monitor

# Generic
cpanm JSON MIME::Base64 Module::List
```

2. Set it up to be be ran by cron by root. Yes, you can directly call
   this script from SNMPD, but be aware, especially with Libvirt,
   there is a very real possibility of the snmpget timing out,
   especially if a VM is spinning up/down as virsh domstats can block
   for a few seconds or so then.

```
*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/hv_monitor > /var/cache/hv_monitor.json -c 2> /dev/null
```

3. Setup snmpd.conf as below.

```
extend hv-monitor /bin/cat
/var/cache/hv_monitor.json

```

4. Restart SNMPD.

5. Either wait for it to be re-discovered or manually enable it.

cpanm Net::ISC::DHCPd::Leases

# FreeBSD
pkg install p5-JSON p5-MIME-Base64 p5-App-cpanminus p5-File-Slurp
cpanm Net::ISC::DHCPd::Leases

# Generic
cpanm Net::ISC::DHCPd::Leases MIME::Base64 File::Slurp
```

### SNMP Extend

1. Copy the shell script to the desired host.
```
wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/dhcp -O /etc/snmp/dhcp
```

2. Make the script executable
```
chmod +x /etc/snmp/dhcp
```

3. Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf) and add:
```
# without using cron
extend dhcpstats /etc/snmp/dhcp -Z
# using cron
extend dhcpstats /bin/cat /var/cache/dhcp_extend
```

4. If on a slow system running it via cron may be needed.
```
*/5 * * * * /etc/snmp/dhcp -Z -w /var/cache/dhcp_extend
```

The following options are also supported.

| Option     | Description                     |
|------------|---------------------------------|
| `-c $file` | Path to dhcpd.conf.             |
| `-l $file` | Path to lease file.             |
| `-Z`       | Enable GZip+Base64 compression. |
| `-d`       | Do not de-dup.                  |
| `-w $file` | File to write it out to.        |

5. Restart snmpd on your host

The application should be auto-discovered as described at the top of
the page. If it is not, please follow the steps set out under `SNMP
Extend` heading top of page.

## Logsize

### SNMP Extend

1. Download the script and make it executable.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/librenms/librenms-agent/master/snmp/logsize -O /etc/snmp/logsize
chmod +x /etc/snmp/logsize
```

2. Install the requirements.

```
# FreeBSD
pkg install p5-File-Find-Rule p5-JSON p5-TOML p5-Time-Piece p5-MIME-Base64 p5-File-Slurp p5-Statistics-Lite

# Debian
apt-get install cpanminus libjson-perl libmime-base64-perl libfile-slurp-perl libtoml-perl libfile-find-rule-perl libstatistics-lite-perl
cpanm Time::Piece

# Generic
cpanm File::Find::Rule JSON TOML Time::Piece MIME::Base64 File::Slurp Statistics::Lite Time::Piece
```

3. Configure the config at `/usr/local/etc/logsize.conf`. You can find
   the documentation for the config file in the extend. Below is a
   small example.

```
# monitor log sizes of logs directly udner /var/log
[sets.var_log]
dir="/var/log/"

# monitor remote logs from network devices
[sets.remote_network]
dir="/var/log/remote/network/"

# monitor remote logs from windows sources
[sets.remote_windows]
dir="/var/log/remote/windows/"

# monitor suricata flows logs sizes
[sets.suricata_flows]
dir="/var/log/suricata/flows/current"
```

4. If the directories all readable via SNMPD, this script can be ran
   via snmpd. Otherwise it needs setup in cron. Similarly is
   processing a large number of files, it may also need setup in cron
   if it takes the script awhile to run.

```
*/5 * * * * /etc/snmp/logsize -b 2> /dev/null > /dev/null
```

5. Make sure that `/var/cache/logsize_extend` exists and is writable
   by the user running the extend.

```
mkdir -p /var/cache/logsize_extend
```

6. Configure it in the SNMPD config.

```
# if not using cron
extend logsize  /etc/snmp/logsize -b
# if using cron
extend logsize /bin/cat /var/cache/logsize_extend/extend_return
```

## linux_config_files

linux_config_files is an application intended to monitor a Linux distribution's configuration files via that distribution's configuration management tool/system.  At this time, ONLY RPM-based (Fedora/RHEL) SYSTEMS ARE SUPPORTED utilizing the rpmconf tool.  The linux_config_files application collects and graphs the total count of configuration files that are out of sync and graphs that number.

Fedora/RHEL: Rpmconf is a utility that analyzes rpm configuration files using the RPM Package Manager.  Rpmconf reports when a new configuration file standard has been issued for an upgraded/downgraded piece of software.  Typically, rpmconf is used to provide a diff of the current configuration file versus the new, standard configuration file.  The administrator can then choose to install the new configuration file or keep the old one.

with following content:

```php
<?php
$mysql_user = 'root';
$mysql_pass = 'toor';
$mysql_host = 'localhost';
$mysql_port = 3306;
```

Note that depending on your MySQL installation (chrooted install for example),
you may have to specify 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost. Localhost make
a MySQL connection via the mysql socket, while 127.0.0.1 make a standard
IP connection to mysql.

Note also if you get a mysql error `Uncaught TypeError: mysqli_num_rows(): Argument #1`,
this is because you are using a newer mysql version which doesnt support `UNBLOCKING` for slave statuses,
so you need to also include the line `$chk_options['slave'] = false;` into `mysql.cnf` to skip checking slave statuses

### Agent

[Install the agent](Agent-Setup.md) on this device if it isn't already

and copy the `mysql` script to `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/`

Verify it is working by running `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/mysql`

### SNMP extend

1. Copy the mysql script to the desired host.
```
wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/mysql -O /etc/snmp/mysql
```

2. Make the file executable
```
chmod +x /etc/snmp/mysql
```

3. Edit /etc/snmp/mysql to set your MySQL connection constants or declare them in /etc/snmp/mysql.cnf (new file)

4. Edit your snmpd.conf file and add:
```
extend mysql /etc/snmp/mysql
```

5. Restart snmpd.

The application should be auto-discovered as described at the top of
the page. If it is not, please follow the steps set out under `SNMP
Extend` heading top of page.

## OS Level Virtualization Monitoring

| OS      | Supported                           |
|---------|-------------------------------------|
| FreeBSD | jails                               |
| Linux   | cgroups v2(Docker, Podman included) |

### SNMP Extend

1. Install the depends...

```shell
# Debian
apt-get install libjson-perl libclone-perl libmime-base64-perl libfile-slurp-perl libio-interface-perl cpanminus

# Generic
cpanm JSON Clone Mime::Base64 File::Slurp IO::Interface
```

2. Install...

```
# FreeBSD
pkg install p5-OSLV-Monitor

# Debian / Generic
cpanm OSLV::Monitor
```

3. Setup cron.

```
 */5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/oslv_monitor -q > /dev/null 2> /dev/null
```

4. Setup snmpd.

```
extend oslv_monitor /bin/cat /var/cache/oslv_monitor/snmp
```

Wait for it to be rediscovered by LibreNMS.

An optional config file may be specified via -f or placed at
`/usr/local/etc/oslv_monitor.json`.

The following keys are used in the JSON config file.

    - include :: An array of regular expressions to include.
        Default :: ["^.*$"]

    - exclude :: An array of regular expressions to exlclude.
        Default :: undef

    - backend :: Override the backend and automatically choose it.

    - time_divider :: Override the time_divider value. The default value varies
        per backend and if it is needed.

Time divider notes.

    - cgroups :: While the default for usec to sec conversion should be 1000000,
              some settings report the value in nanoseconds, requiring 1000000000.
        Default :: 1000000

    - FreeBSD :: not used

By Defaults the backends are as below.

    FreeBSD: FreeBSD
    Linux: cgroups

Default would be like this.

```json
{
  "include": ["^.*$"]
}
```


### Metric Notes

| Key                     | Description                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `running_$name`         | 0 or 1 based on if it is running or not.                     |
| `oslvm___$name___$stat` | The a specific stat for a specific OSLVMs.                   |
| `totals_$stat`          | A stat representing a total for all stats across all OSLVMs. |

Something is considered not running if it has been seen. How long
something is considred to have been seen is controlled by
`apps.oslv_monitor.seen_age`, which is the number of seconds ago it
would of have to be seen. The default is `604800` which is seven days
in seconds.

All time values are in seconds.

All counter stats are per second values for that time period.

### Backend Notes

#### FreeBSD

The stats names match those produced by `ps --libxo json`.

#### Linux cgroups v2

The cgroup to name mapping is done like below.

- systemd -> s_$name
- user -> u_$name
- docker -> d_$name
- podman -> p_$name
- anything else -> $name

The following ps to stats mapping are as below.

- %cpu -> percent-cpu
- %mem -> percent-memory
- rss -> rss
- vsize -> virtual-size
- trs -> text-size
- drs -> data-size
- size -> size

"procs" is a total number of procs in that cgroup.

The rest of the values are pulled from the following files with
the names kept as is.

- cpu.stat
- io.stat
- memory.stat

The following mappings are done though.

- pgfault -> minor-faults
- pgmajfault -> major-faults
- usage_usec -> cpu-time
- system_usec -> system-time
- user_usec -> user-time
- throttled_usecs -> throttled-time

## OS Updates

A small shell script that checks your system package manager for any
available updates. Supports apt-get/pacman/yum/zypper package
managers.

For pacman users automatically refreshing the database, it is
recommended you use an alternative database location
`--dbpath=/var/lib/pacman/checkupdate`

### SNMP Extend

```

4. Restart snmpd on your host

_Note_: apt-get depends on an updated package index. There are several
ways to have your system run `apt-get update` automatically. The
easiest is to create `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic` and pasting the
following in it: `APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";`. If you
have apticron, cron-apt or apt-listchanges installed and configured,
chances are that packages are already updated periodically .

The application should be auto-discovered as described at the top of
the page. If it is not, please follow the steps set out under `SNMP
Extend` heading top of page.

### Agent

[Install the agent](Agent-Setup.md) on this device if it isn't already

   specified using the the `-f` switch. Akin to like below. For more
   information, see `/etc/snmp/php-fpm --help`.
```json
{
"pools":{
         "thefrog": "https://thefrog/fpm-status",
         "foobar": "https://foo.bar/fpm-status"
    }
}
```

6. Restart snmpd on the host

The application should be auto-discovered as described at the top of
the page. If it is not, please follow the steps set out under `SNMP

```
>Will monitor HTTP, LDAP, and IMAP. The -p switch specifies what ports to use. This is a comma seperated list.
>
>These must be found in '/etc/services' or where ever NSS is set to fetch it from. If not, it will throw an error.
>
>If you want to JSON returned by it to be printed in a pretty format use the -P flag.

## Postfix

### SNMP Extend

1. Copy the shell script, postfix-queues, to the desired host
```
wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/postfix-queues -O /etc/snmp/postfix-queues
```

2. Copy the Perl script, postfixdetailed, to the desired host
```
wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/postfixdetailed -O /etc/snmp/postfixdetailed
```

3. Make both scripts executable
```
chmod +x /etc/snmp/postfixdetailed /etc/snmp/postfix-queues
```

4. Edit your snmpd.conf file and add:
```
extend mailq /etc/snmp/postfix-queues
extend postfixdetailed /etc/snmp/postfixdetailed
```

5. Restart snmpd.

6. Install pflogsumm for your OS.

7. Make sure the cache file in /etc/snmp/postfixdetailed is some place
that snmpd can write too. This file is used for tracking changes
between various values between each time it is called by snmpd. Also
make sure the path for pflogsumm is correct.

8. Run /etc/snmp/postfixdetailed to create the initial cache file so
you don't end up with some crazy initial starting value. Please note
that each time /etc/snmp/postfixdetailed is ran, the cache file is
updated, so if this happens in between LibreNMS doing it then the
values will be thrown off for that polling period.

The application should be auto-discovered as described at the top of
the page. If it is not, please follow the steps set out under `SNMP
Extend` heading top of page.

> NOTE: If using RHEL for your postfix server, qshape must be
> installed manually as it is not officially supported. CentOs 6 rpms
> seem to work without issues.

the postgres DB in totalling (e.g. set ignorePG to 0, default: 1), or set a
hostname for check_postgres.pl to connect to (default: the Unix Socket postgresql
is running on), then create the file /etc/snmp/postgres.config with the following
contents (note that not all of them need be defined, just whichever you'd like to
change):
```
DBuser=monitoring
ignorePG=0
DBhost=localhost
```

Note that if you are using netdata or the like, you may wish to set ignorePG
to 1 or otherwise that total will be very skewed on systems with light or
moderate usage.

## PowerMon

PowerMon tracks the power usage on your host and can report on both consumption
and cost, using a python script installed on the host.

[PowerMon consumption graph](../img/example-app-powermon-consumption-02.png)

Currently the script uses one of two methods to determine current power usage:

* ACPI via libsensors

* HP-Health (HP Proliant servers only)

The ACPI method is quite unreliable as it is usually only implemented by
battery-powered devices, e.g. laptops. YMMV. However, it's possible to support
any method as long as it can return a power value, usually in Watts.

> TIP: You can achieve this by adding a method and a function for that method to
> the script. It should be called by getData() and return a dictionary.

Because the methods are unreliable for all hardware, you need to declare to the
script which method to use. The are several options to assist with testing, see
`--help`.

### SNMP Extend

#### Initial setup

1. Download the python script onto the host:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/librenms/librenms-agent/master/snmp/powermon-snmp.py -O /usr/local/bin/powermon-snmp.py
```

2. Make the script executable:
```
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/powermon-snmp.py
```

3. Edit the script and set the cost per kWh for your supply. You must uncomment
this line for the script to work:
```
vi /usr/local/bin/powermon-snmp.py
#costPerkWh = 0.15
```

4. Choose you method below:

    === "Method 1. sensors"

        * Install dependencies:
        ```
        dnf install lm_sensors
        pip install PySensors
        ```

        * Test the script from the command-line. For example:
        ```
        $ /usr/local/bin/powermon-snmp.py -m sensors -n -p
        {
          "meter": {
            "0": {
              "reading": 0.0
            }
          },
          "psu": {},
          "supply": {
            "rate": 0.15
          },
          "reading": "0.0"
        }
        ```

        If you see a reading of `0.0` it is likely this method is not supported for
        your system. If not, continue.

    === "Method 2. hpasmcli"

        * Obtain the hp-health package for your system. Generally there are
        three options:
            * Standalone package from [HPE Support](https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/swd/public/detail?swItemId=MTX-c0104db95f574ae6be873e2064#tab2)
            * From the HP Management Component Pack (MCP).
            * Included in the [HP Service Pack for Proliant (SPP)](https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/docDisplay?docId=emr_na-a00026884en_us)

        * If you've downloaded the standalone package, install it. For example:
        ```
        rpm -ivh hp-health-10.91-1878.11.rhel8.x86_64.rpm
        ```

        * Check the service is running:
        ```
        systemctl status hp-health
        ```

        * Test the script from the command-line. For example:
        ```
        $ /usr/local/bin/powermon-snmp.py -m hpasmcli -n -p
        {
          "meter": {
            "1": {
              "reading": 338.0
            }
          },
          "psu": {
            "1": {
              "present": "Yes",
              "redundant": "No",
              "condition": "Ok",
              "hotplug": "Supported",
              "reading": 315.0
            },
            "2": {
              "present": "Yes",
              "redundant": "No",
              "condition": "FAILED",
              "hotplug": "Supported"
            }
          },
          "supply": {
            "rate": 0.224931
          },
          "reading": 338.0
        }
        ```

        If you see a reading of `0.0` it is likely this method is not supported for
        your system. If not, continue.

    #### Finishing Up

5. Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf`) and add the following:
```
extend  powermon   /usr/local/bin/powermon-snmp.py -m hpasmcli
```

    > NOTE: Avoid using other script options in the snmpd config as the results may not be
    > interpreted correctly by LibreNMS.

6. Reload your snmpd service:
```
systemctl reload snmpd
```

7. You're now ready to enable the application in LibreNMS.


## Privoxy

For this to work, the following log items need enabled for Privoxy.

```
debug     2 # show each connection status
debug   512 # Common Log Format
debug  1024 # Log the destination for requests Privoxy didn't let through, and the reason why.
debug  4096 # Startup banner and warnings
debug  8192 # Non-fatal errors
```

### SNMP Extend

1. Download the extend and make sure it is executable.
```
wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/privoxy -O /etc/snmp/privoxy
chmod +x /etc/snmp/privoxy
```

2. Install the depdenencies.
```
# FreeBSD
pkg install p5-JSON p5-MIME-Base64 p5-File-Slurp p5-File-ReadBackwards p5-IPC-Run3 p5-Time-Piece

# Debian
apt-get install libjson-perl libmime-base64-perl libfile-slurp-perl libfile-readbackwards-perl libipc-run3-perl cpanminus
cpanm Time::Piece

# Generic
cpanm Time::Piece JSON MIME::Base64 File::Slurp File::ReadBackwards IPC::Run3
```

3. Add the extend to snmpd.conf and restart snmpd.
```
extend privoxy /etc/snmp/privoxy
```

If your logfile is not at `/var/log/privoxy/logfile`, that may be
changed via the `-f` option.

If `privoxy-log-parser.pl` is not found in your standard `$PATH`
setting, you may will need up call the extend via `/usr/bin/env` with
a `$PATH` set to something that includes it.

Once that is done, just wait for the server to be rediscovered or just
enable it manually.

If you are having timeouts or there is privelege seperation issues,
then it can be ran via cron like below. `-w` can be used to write it
out and `-o` can be used to control where it is written to. See
`--help` for more information.

```
# cron
*/5 * * * * root /etc/snmp/privoxy -w > /dev/null

# snmpd.conf
extend privoxy /bin/cat /var/cache/privoxy_extend.json.snmp
```

The application should be auto-discovered as described at the top of
the page. If it is not, please follow the steps set out under `SNMP
Extend` heading top of page.

## Seafile

SNMP extend script to monitor your Seafile Server

### SNMP Extend

1. Copy the Python script, seafile.py, to the desired host
```
wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/seafile.py -O /etc/snmp/seafile.py
```

Also you have to install the requests Package for Python3.
Under Ubuntu/Debian just run `apt install python3-requests`

2. Make the script executable
```
chmod +x /etc/snmp/seafile.py
```

3. Edit your snmpd.conf file and add:
```
extend seafile /etc/snmp/seafile.py
```

4. You will also need to create the config file, which is named
seafile.json . The script has to be located at /etc/snmp/.
```
{"url": "https://seafile.mydomain.org",
 "username": "some_admin_login@mail.address",
 "password": "password",
 "account_identifier": "name"
 "hide_monitoring_account": true
}
```

The variables are as below.

```
url = Url how to get access to Seafile Server
username = Login to Seafile Server.
           It is important that used Login has admin privileges.
           Otherwise most API calls will be denied.
password = Password to the configured login.
account_identifier = Defines how user accounts are listed in RRD Graph.
                     Options are: name, email
hide_monitoring_account = With this Boolean you can hide the Account which you
                          use to access Seafile API
```

**Note:**It is recommended to use a dedicated Administrator account for monitoring.

## SMART

### SNMP Extend

1. Copy the Perl script, smart, to the desired host.
```
wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/smart-v1 -O /etc/snmp/smart
```

2. Install the depends.
```
# FreeBSD
pkg install p5-JSON p5-MIME-Base64 smartmontools
# Debian
apt-get install smartmontools libjson-perl libmime-base64-perl
# CentOS
dnf install smartmontools perl-JSON perl-MIME-Base64
```

3. Make the script executable
```
chmod +x /etc/snmp/smart
```

4. Setup a cronjob to run it. This ensures slow to poll disks won't
   result in errors.

```
 */5 * * * * /etc/snmp/smart -u -Z
```

5. Edit your snmpd.conf file and add:
```
extend smart /bin/cat /var/cache/smart
```

6. You will also need to create the config file, which defaults to the same path as the script,
but with .config appended. So if the script is located at /etc/snmp/smart, the config file
will be `/etc/snmp/smart.config`. Alternatively you can also specific a config via `-c`.

Anything starting with a # is comment. The format for variables is $variable=$value. Empty
lines are ignored. Spaces and tabes at either the start or end of a line are ignored. Any
line with out a matched variable or # are treated as a disk.

```
#This is a comment
cache=/var/cache/smart
smartctl=/usr/bin/env smartctl
useSN=1
ada0
ada1
da5 /dev/da5 -d sat
twl0,0 /dev/twl0 -d 3ware,0
twl0,1 /dev/twl0 -d 3ware,1
twl0,2 /dev/twl0 -d 3ware,2
```

The variables are as below.

```
cache = The path to the cache file to use. Default: /var/cache/smart
smartctl = The path to use for smartctl. Default: /usr/bin/env smartctl
useSN = If set to 1, it will use the disks SN for reporting instead of the device name.
        1 is the default. 0 will use the device name.
```

A disk line is can be as simple as just a disk name under /dev/. Such as in the config above
The line "ada0" would resolve to "/dev/ada0" and would be called with no special argument. If
a line has a space in it, everything before the space is treated as the disk name and is what
used for reporting and everything after that is used as the argument to be passed to smartctl.

If you want to guess at the configuration, call it with -g and it will print out what it thinks
it should be.

6. Restart snmpd on your host

The application should be auto-discovered as described at the top of
the page. If it is not, please follow the steps set out under `SNMP
Extend` heading top of page.

7. Optionally setup nightly self tests for the disks. The exend will
   run the specified test on all configured disks if called with the
   -t flag and the name of the SMART test to run.

```
 0 0 * * * /etc/snmp/smart -t long
```

## Sneck

This is for replacing Nagios/Icinga or the LibreNMS service
integration in regards to NRPE. This allows LibreNMS to query what
checks were ran on the server and keep track of totals of OK, WARNING,
CRITICAL, and UNKNOWN statuses.

The big advantage over this compared to a NRPE are as below.

- It does not need to know what checks are configured on it.
- Also does not need to wait for the tests to run as sneck is meant to
  be ran via cron and the then return the cache when queried via SNMP,
  meaning a lot faster response time, especially if slow checks are
  being performed.
- Works over proxied SNMP connections.

Included are alert examples. Although for setting up custom ones, the
metrics below are provided.

| Metric              | Description                                                                                                           |

| time_to_polling     | Differnce in seconds between when polling data was generated and when polled                                          |
| time_to_polling_abs | The absolute value of time_to_polling.                                                                                |
| check_$CHECK        | Exit status of a specific check `$CHECK` is equal to the name of the check in question. So `foo` would be `check_foo` |

The standard Nagios/Icinga style exit codes are used and those are as
below.

| Exit | Meaning  |
|------|----------|
| 0    | okay     |
| 1    | warning  |
| 2    | critical |
| 3+   | unknown  |

To use `time_to_polling`, it will need to enabled via setting the
config item below. The default is false. Unless set to true, this
value will default to 0. If enabling this, one will want to make sure
that NTP is in use every were or it will alert if it goes over a
difference of 540s.

```
lnms config:set app.sneck.polling_time_diff true
```

### SNMP Extend

1. Install the extend.

```
# FreeBSD
pkg install p5-JSON p5-File-Slurp p5-MIME-Base64 p5-App-cpanminus
cpanm Monitoring::Sneck

# Debian based systems
apt-get install cpanminus libjson-perl libfile-slurp-perl libmime-base64-perl
cpanm Monitoring::Sneck

# Generic
cpanm Monitoring::Sneck
```

2. Configure any of the checks you want to run in
   `/usr/local/etc/sneck.conf`. You con find it documented
   [here](https://metacpan.org/pod/Monitoring::Sneck#CONFIG-FORMAT).

3. Set it up in cron. This will mean you don't need to wait for all
   the checks to complete when polled via SNMP, which for like SMART
   or other long running checks will mean it timing out. Also means it
   does not need called via sudo as well.

```
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/env PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin /usr/local/bin/sneck -u 2> /dev/null > /dev/null
```

4. Set it up in the snmpd config and restart snmpd. The `-c` flag will
   tell read it to read from cache instead of rerunning the checks.

```
extend sneck /usr/bin/env PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin /usr/local/bin/sneck -c
```

5. In LibreNMS, enable the application for the server in question or wait for auto
   discovery to find it.

## Squid

### SNMP Proxy

1. Enable SNMP for Squid like below, if you have not already, and restart it.
```
acl snmppublic snmp_community public
snmp_port 3401
snmp_access allow snmppublic localhost
snmp_access deny all
```

2. Restart squid on your host.

3. Edit your snmpd.conf file and add, making sure you have the same
community, host, and port as above:
```
proxy -v 2c -Cc -c public 127.0.0.1:3401 1.3.6.1.4.1.3495
```

For more advanced information on Squid and SNMP or setting up proxying
for net-snmp, please see the links below.

<http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/Snmp>
<http://www.net-snmp.org/wiki/index.php/Snmpd_proxy>

## Supervisord

It shows you the totals per status and also the uptime per process. That way you can add alerts for instance when there are process in state `FATAL`.

### SNMP Extend

1. Copy the python script to the desired host.
```
wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/supervisord.py -O /etc/snmp/supervisord.py
```
Notice that this will use the default unix socket path. Modify the `unix_socket_path` variable in the script if your path differs from the default.

2. Make the script executable
```
chmod +x /etc/snmp/supervisord.py
```

3. Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf) and add:
```
extend supervisord /etc/snmp/supervisord.py
```

4. Restart snmpd on your host
```
systemctl restart snmpd
```

## Sagan

For metrics the stats are migrated as below from the stats JSON.

`f_drop_percent` and `drop_percent` are computed based on the found data.

| Instance Key       | Stats JSON Key                     |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| uptime             | .stats.uptime                      |
| total              | .stats.captured.total              |
| drop               | .stats.captured.drop               |
| ignore             | .stats.captured.ignore             |
| threshold          | .stats.captured.theshold           |
| after              | .stats.captured.after              |
| match              | .stats.captured.match              |
| bytes              | .stats.captured.bytes_total        |
| bytes_ignored      | .stats.captured.bytes_ignored      |
| max_bytes_log_line | .stats.captured.max_bytes_log_line |
| eps                | .stats.captured.eps                |
| f_total            | .stats.flow.total                  |
| f_dropped          | .stats.flow.dropped                |

Those keys are appended with the name of the instance running with `_`
between the instance name and instance metric key. So `uptime` for
`ids` would be `ids_uptime`.

The default is named 'ids' unless otherwise specified via the extend.

There is a special instance name of `.total` which is the total of all
the instances. So if you want the total eps, the metric would be
`.total_eps`. Also worth noting that the alert value is the highest
one found among all the instances.

### SNMP Extend

1. Install the extend.
```
# FreeBSD
pkg install p5-JSON p5-File-ReadBackwards p5-File-Slurp p5-MIME-Base64 p5-Time-Piece p5-App-cpanminus
cpanm Sagan::Monitoring

# Debian
apt-get install libjson-perl libfile-readbackwards-perl libfile-slurp-perl libmime-base64-perl cpanminus
cpanm Sagan::Monitoring

# Generic
cpanm Sagan::Monitoring
```

2. Setup cron. Below is a example.
```
*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/sagan_stat_check > /dev/null
```

3. Configure snmpd.conf
```
extend sagan-stats /usr/bin/env PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin sagan_stat_check -c
```

4. Restart snmpd on your system.

You will want to make sure that sagan is setup to with the values set
below for stats-json processor, for a single instance setup..

```
enabled: yes
time: 300
subtract_old_values: true
filename: "$LOG_PATH/stats.json"
```

Any configuration of sagan_stat_check should be done in the cron
setup. If the default does not work, check the docs for it at
[MetaCPAN for
sagan_stat_check](https://metacpan.org/dist/Sagan-Monitoring/view/bin/sagan_stat_check)


## Socket Statistics (ss)

The Socket Statistics application polls ss and scrapes socket statuses.  Individual sockets and address-families may be filtered out within the script's optional configuration JSON file.

1. The following socket types are polled directly.  Filtering a socket type will disable direct polling as-well-as indirect polling within any address-families that list the socket type as their child:
```
dccp (also exists within address-families "inet" and "inet6")
mptcp (also exists within address-families "inet" and "inet6")
raw (also exists within address-families "inet" and "inet6")
sctp (also exists within address-families "inet" and "inet6")
tcp (also exists within address-families "inet" and "inet6")
udp (also exists within address-families "inet" and "inet6")
xdp
```

2. The following socket types are polled within an address-family only:
```
inet6 (within address-family "inet6")
p_dgr (within address-family "link")
p_raw (within address-family "link")
ti_dg (within address-family "tipc")
ti_rd (within address-family "tipc")
ti_sq (within address-family "tipc")
ti_st (within address-family "tipc")
v_dgr (within address-family "vsock")
v_str (within address-family "vsock")
unknown (within address-families "inet", "inet6", "link", "tipc", and "vsock")
```

3. The following address-families are polled directly and have their child socket types tab-indented below them.  Filtering a socket type (see "1" above) will filter it from the address-family.  Filtering an address-family will filter out all of its child socket types.  However, if those socket types are not DIRECTLY filtered out (see "1" above), then they will continue to be monitored either directly or within other address-families in which they exist:
```
inet
    dccp
    mptcp
    raw
    sctp
    tcp
    udp
    unknown
inet6
    dccp
    icmp6
    mptcp
    raw
    sctp
    tcp
    udp
    unknown
link
    p_dgr
    p_raw
    unknown
netlink
tipc
    ti_dg
    ti_rd
    ti_sq
    ti_st
    unknown
unix
    u_dgr
    u_seq
    u_str
vsock
    v_dgr
    v_str
    unknown
```

### SNMP Extend

1. Copy the python script, ss.py, to the desired host
```
wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/ss.py -O /etc/snmp/ss.py
```

2. Make the script executable
```
chmod +x /etc/snmp/ss.py
```

3. Edit your snmpd.conf file and add:
```
extend ss /etc/snmp/ss.py
```

4. (Optional) Create a /etc/snmp/ss.json file and specify:
    1. "ss_cmd" - String path to the ss binary: ["/sbin/ss"]
    2. "socket_types" - A comma-delimited list of socket types to include.  The following socket types are valid: dccp, icmp6, mptcp, p_dgr, p_raw, raw, sctp, tcp, ti_dg, ti_rd, ti_sq, ti_st, u_dgr, u_seq, u_str, udp, unknown, v_dgr, v_dgr, xdp.  Please note that the "unknown" socket type is represented in /sbin/ss output with the netid "???".  Please also note that the p_dgr and p_raw socket types are specific to the "link" address family; the ti_dg, ti_rd, ti_sq, and ti_st socket types are specific to the "tipc" address family; the u_dgr, u_seq, and u_str socket types are specific to the "unix" address family; and the v_dgr and v_str socket types are specific to the "vsock" address family.  Filtering out the parent address families for the aforementioned will also filter out their specific socket types.  Specifying "all" includes all of the socket types.  For example: to include only tcp, udp, icmp6 sockets, you would specify "tcp,udp,icmp6": ["all"]
    3. "addr_families" - A comma-delimited list of address families to include.  The following families are valid: inet, inet6, link, netlink, tipc, unix, vsock.  As mentioned above under (b), filtering out the link, tipc, unix, or vsock address families will also filter out their respective socket types.  Specifying "all" includes all of the families.  For example: to include only inet and inet6 families, you would specify "inet,inet6": ["all"]
```
{
    "ss_cmd": "/sbin/ss",
    "socket_types": "all"
    "addr_families": "all"
}
```
In order to filter out uncommon/unused socket types, the following JSON configuration is recommended:
```
{
    "ss_cmd": "/sbin/ss",
    "socket_types": "icmp6,p_dgr,p_raw,raw,tcp,u_dgr,u_seq,u_str,udp",
    "addr_families": "inet,inet6,link,netlink,unix"
}
```

5. (Optional) If SELinux is in Enforcing mode, you must add a module so the script can poll sockets:
```
cat << EOF > snmpd_ss.te
module snmp_ss 1.0;

require {
	type snmpd_t;
	class netlink_tcpdiag_socket { bind create getattr nlmsg_read read setopt write };
}

#============= snmpd_t ==============

allow snmpd_t self:netlink_tcpdiag_socket { bind create getattr nlmsg_read read setopt write };
EOF
checkmodule -M -m -o snmpd_ss.mod snmpd_ss.te
semodule_package -o snmpd_ss.pp -m snmpd_ss.mod
semodule -i snmpd_ss.pp
```

6. Restart snmpd.

## Suricata

### SNMP Extend

1. Install the extend.
```
# FreeBSD
pkg install p5-JSON p5-File-Path p5-File-Slurp p5-Time-Piece p5-MIME-Base64 p5-Hash-Flatten p5-Carp p5-App-cpanminus
cpanm Suricata::Monitoring

# Debian
apt-get install libjson-perl libfile-path-perl libfile-slurp-perl libmime-base64-perl cpanminus
cpanm Suricata::Monitoring

# Generic
cpanm Suricata::Monitoring
```

2. Setup cron. Below is a example.
```
*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/suricata_stat_check > /dev/null
```

3. Configure snmpd.conf
```
extend suricata-stats /usr/bin/env PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin suricata_stat_check -c
```

Or if you want to use try compressing the return via Base64+GZIP...

```
extend suricata-stats /usr/bin/env PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin suricata_stat_check -c -b
```

4. Restart snmpd on your system.

You will want to make sure Suricata is set to output the stats
to the eve file once a minute. This will help make sure that
it won't be to far back in the file and will make sure it is
recent when the cronjob runs.

Any configuration of suricata_stat_check should be done in the cron
setup. If the default does not work, check the docs for it at
[MetaCPAN for
suricata_stat_check](https://metacpan.org/dist/Suricata-Monitoring/view/bin/suricata_stat_check)


## Suricata Extract

### SNMP

1. Add the following to your snmpd config and restart. Path may have
to be adjusted depending on where `suricata_extract_submit_extend` is
installed to.
```
extend suricata_extract /usr/local/bin/suricata_extract_submit_extend
```

Then just wait for the system to be rediscovered or enable it manually
for the server in question.

## Systemd

The systemd application polls systemd and scrapes systemd units' load, activation, and sub states.

### SNMP Extend

1. Copy the python script, systemd.py, to the desired host
```
wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/systemd.py -O /etc/snmp/systemd.py
```

2. Make the script executable
```
chmod +x /etc/snmp/systemd.py
```

3. Edit your snmpd.conf file and add:
```
extend systemd /etc/snmp/systemd.py
```

4. (Optional) Create a /etc/snmp/systemd.json file and specify:
    1. "systemctl_cmd" - String path to the systemctl binary [Default: "/usr/bin/systemctl"]
    2. "include_inactive_units" - True/False string to include inactive units in results [Default: "False"]
```
{
    "systemctl_cmd": "/bin/systemctl",
    "include_inactive_units": "True"
}
```

5. (Optional) If you have SELinux in Enforcing mode, you must add a module so the script can access systemd state:
```
cat << EOF > snmpd_systemctl.te
module snmpd_systemctl 1.0;

require {
        type snmpd_t;
        type systemd_systemctl_exec_t;
        type init_t;
        class file { execute execute_no_trans map open read };
        class unix_stream_socket connectto;
        class system status;
}

#============= snmpd_t ==============
allow snmpd_t init_t:system status;
allow snmpd_t init_t:unix_stream_socket connectto;
allow snmpd_t systemd_systemctl_exec_t:file { execute execute_no_trans map open read };
EOF
checkmodule -M -m -o snmpd_systemctl.mod snmpd_systemctl.te
semodule_package -o snmpd_systemctl.pp -m snmpd_systemctl.mod
semodule -i snmpd_systemctl.pp
```

6. Restart snmpd.

## TinyDNS aka djbdns

### Agent

[Install the agent](Agent-Setup.md) on this device if it isn't already
and copy the `tinydns` script to `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/`

_Note_: We assume that you use DJB's
[Daemontools](http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html) to start/stop
tinydns. And that your tinydns instance is located in `/service/dns`,
adjust this path if necessary.

1. Replace your _log_'s `run` file, typically located in
   `/service/dns/log/run` with:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
exec setuidgid dnslog tinystats ./main/tinystats/ multilog t n3 s250000 ./main/
```

2. Create tinystats directory and chown:
```bash
mkdir /service/dns/log/main/tinystats
chown dnslog:nofiles /service/dns/log/main/tinystats
```

3. Restart TinyDNS and Daemontools: `/etc/init.d/svscan restart`
   _Note_: Some say `svc -t /service/dns` is enough, on my install
   (Gentoo) it doesn't rehook the logging and I'm forced to restart it
   entirely.

## Unbound

Unbound configuration:

```text
# Enable extended statistics.
server:
        extended-statistics: yes
        statistics-cumulative: yes

remote-control:
        control-enable: yes
        control-interface: 127.0.0.1

```

Restart your unbound after changing the configuration, verify it is
working by running `unbound-control stats`.

### Option 1. SNMP Extend (Preferred and easiest method)

1. Copy the shell script, unbound, to the desired host
```
wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/unbound -O /etc/snmp/unbound
```

2. Make the script executable
```
chmod +x /etc/snmp/unbound
```

3. Edit your snmpd.conf file and add:
```
extend unbound /usr/bin/sudo /etc/snmp/unbound
```

the page. If it is not, please follow the steps set out under `SNMP
Extend` heading top of page.

Optionally if you have multiple UPS or your UPS is not named APCUPS you can specify its name as an argument into `/etc/snmp/ups-nut.sh`
```
extend ups-nut /etc/snmp/ups-nut.sh ups1
extend ups-nut /etc/snmp/ups-nut.sh ups2
```

## UPS-apcups

A small shell script that exports apcacess ups status.

### SNMP Extend

1. Copy the shell script, unbound, to the desired host

```

3. Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf) and add:
```
extend ups-apcups /etc/snmp/ups-apcups
```

If 'apcaccess' is not in the PATH enviromental variable snmpd is
using, you may need to do something like below.

```
extend ups-apcups/usr/bin/env PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin /etc/snmp/ups-apcups
```
