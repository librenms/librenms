# General

Like any good software we take security seriously. However, bugs do
make it into the software along with the history of the code base we
inherited. It's how we deal with identified vulnerabilities that
should show that we take things seriously.

# Securing your install

As with any system of this nature, we highly recommend that you
restrict access to the install via a firewall or VPN.

It is also highly recommended that the Web interface is protected with
an SSL certificate such as ones provided by [LetsEncrypt](http://www.letsencrypt.org).

Please ensure you keep your install [up to date](Updating.md).

# Reporting vulnerabilities

Like anyone, we appreciate the work people put in to find flaws in
software and welcome anyone to do so with LibreNMS, this will lead to
better quality and more secure software for everyone.

If you think you've found a vulnerability and want to discuss it with
some of the core team then you can email us at
[team@librenms.org](mailto:team@librenms.org) and we will endeavour to
get back to as quick as we can, this is usually within 24 hours.

We are happy to attribute credit to the findings but we ask that we're
given a chance to patch any vulnerability before public disclosure so
that our users can update as soon as a fix is available.
